/// <para>The occlusion pass needs a normal at every pixel and has never had one: it
/// differences the depth buffer across four neighbours and takes a cross product,
/// which straddles a silhouette wherever two surfaces meet and is quantised by the
/// depth everywhere else. That was the only source available while the geometry was
/// something that went past — GP0 words arriving in a stream nothing held.</para>
///
/// <para>It is held now. The port assembles the polygons itself
/// (<c>patches/PolyAssembler.cs</c>) and enumerates the scene
/// (<c>patches/TileWalk.cs</c>, <c>patches/ModelWalk.cs</c>), so the frame's geometry
/// can simply be kept as it is submitted and drawn again into a normal buffer once
/// the frame is finished. A triangle's normal is then the plane's own, exact and
/// constant across the face, rather than a guess made from its neighbours' depths.</para>
///
/// <para>The list is <b>per render target</b> and not per frame, because with two
/// display buffers the target being presented is the one drawn a frame ago — the same
/// reason the depth attachment lives on the target. It is dropped the first time a
/// target is drawn in a new frame, which is the condition its depth is cleared on.</para>
///
/// <para>Order is the whole of the correctness argument. The triangles are kept in
/// submission order and redrawn with no depth test, so the last normal written at a
/// pixel belongs to the last triangle drawn there — which under painter's order is
/// the same surface whose depth the pass reads. No test, no sort, and nothing to
/// disagree with the depth buffer about.</para>
