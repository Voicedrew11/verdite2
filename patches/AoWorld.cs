/// **A screen-space pass can only be occluded by what is on screen.** Stand in a
/// corner facing one wall and the wall behind the camera contributes nothing, so
/// the corner is only as dark as the part of it in shot — and the shading changes
/// as the view turns, which is the artefact that reads as the effect being unstable
/// rather than as the room being dark. No radius and no sample count fixes it; it
/// is what the depth buffer *is*.
///
/// The port is not limited to the picture any more. `TileWalk` enumerates the map's
/// cells, `Map` reads the same 80x80 grid for the minimap, and the grid holds the
/// whole area — including the tiles behind the camera. This publishes two things the
/// occlusion pass needs to use it, and nothing else:
///
/// **The transform, and the reason it is exact.** `func_80031950` loads a view
/// matrix from `0x80192E18` before every tile half, and `TileWalk.Place` shows what
/// the game feeds it: `(tx &lt;&lt; 11) - CamWorldX`, a position *already relative to
/// the camera* in world axes. So that matrix is the camera's rotation alone — no
/// translation, no per-object rotation composed into it — and inverting it turns a
/// view position straight back into a world one. Nothing has to be assumed about how
/// the game composes pitch, yaw and roll, which is the part a guess would get wrong.
///
/// **The floor plan.** The grid's height byte is the same one the game turns into a
/// tile's Y (`Elevate`: `(0 - height) &lt;&lt; 7`), so a height of `h` is a floor
/// `h * 128` above the world's zero. A step between two tiles is a wall, which is
/// what makes a plain heightfield enough to occlude a dungeon: the pass marches it
/// in world space, where being off screen means nothing.
///
/// **Off by default.** The mechanism is measured; the picture is one nobody has
/// seen, and unlike the rest of the occlusion pass this one can darken a place the
/// player is looking away from, which is a judgement rather than a measurement.
/// See "Occluders the camera cannot see" in docs/RENDERING.md.
