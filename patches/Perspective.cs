/// Perspective-correct texture mapping — the fix for the swimming, rippling
/// textures that are the most recognisable thing about a PlayStation picture.
///
///     KF2_PERSPECTIVE=0             off; 1 or unset leaves it on
///     KF2_PERSPECTIVE_PROBE=1       report the vertex map's hit rate
///     KF2_PERSPECTIVE_FALLBACK=1    also guess, by screen position, for the
///                                   vertices the exact map could not answer for
///
/// The console's GPU has no depth. The GTE does the perspective divide, the game
/// copies the resulting 2D screen coordinate into a GP0 packet, and the GPU
/// receives a polygon that is nothing but screen positions, UVs and colours. It
/// can only interpolate U and V linearly across the screen, which is exact for a
/// surface square-on to the camera and progressively wrong as the surface turns
/// away — so a floor's texture slides as you walk over it, and a quad shows a
/// crease along the diagonal where its two triangles disagree about where the
/// middle of the texture went.
///
/// Nothing in the packet can fix that; the depth is simply gone by then. So it is
/// caught earlier, in <see cref="GteVertexMap"/>: <c>Gte.Rtp</c> knows the screen
/// position and the view depth SZ3 in the same call, and the coordinate then travels
/// to the GPU through memory — <c>swc2</c> into the game's vertex cache, a whole-word
/// <c>lw</c>/<c>sw</c> into the primitive packet, and a read by <c>DrawOTag</c> or by
/// the DMA. The map follows it by **address**, which is the vertex itself, and checks
/// the word it recorded against the word the GPU is drawing before it answers.
///
/// It used to follow the coordinate by its screen position, which is not an identity:
/// two vertices share a pixel constantly and every off-screen vertex shares the ±1024
/// clamp, so the answer was a depth for that pixel rather than for that vertex. W is
/// the denominator of the perspective divide, so a wrong one did not soften a texture,
/// it threw it across the screen — and the same wrong pick handed a corner another
/// corner's sub-pixel fraction, which is a vertex that snaps for no visible reason.
///
/// A vertex that misses is left alone, which is what makes this safe to leave on:
///
///   * The **HUD and the menus** never went through the GTE, so they never hit,
///     so they keep the affine mapping 2D work actually wants.
///   * A polygon is corrected **only if every one of its vertices hit**, so it can
///     never mix a recovered depth with a fallback and shear itself apart.
///   * A coordinate the game computed itself, or edited after copying it, fails the
///     value check and stays affine rather than borrowing a stranger's depth.
///
/// Both renderers honour it. The software rasterizer interpolates U/W, V/W and 1/W
/// and divides per pixel; the hardware backend puts the depth in
/// <c>gl_Position.w</c> and lets the rasterizer do it, with <c>noperspective</c> on
/// the colour so Gouraud shading stays exactly as flat as the console's. A vertex
/// with no depth carries W = 1 and the vertex shader writes the original expression
/// for it, so everything that is not corrected is bit-identical to before.
///
/// This patch itself is only the switch and the report — the work is all in the
/// runtime, since a texture coordinate is decided a long way below anything
/// <c>HookManager</c> can reach. The one hook is on <c>DrawOTag</c>, purely to have
/// a frame boundary to count against, and it is a post-hook so it composes with the
/// widescreen mod's replacement of the same function.
