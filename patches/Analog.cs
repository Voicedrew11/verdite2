/// King's Field is a digital-pad game: one 16-bit button word a frame and a
/// fixed step for everything. The port has had real sticks all along --
/// InputManager fills Controller.LeftX/LeftY/RightX/RightY -- but the game asks
/// the BIOS for PAD_dr and sees a digital pad, so nothing consumed them; the
/// runtime's default binding just wires the left stick to the D-pad, which means
/// the stick *turns* at the game's fixed rate.
///
/// What makes real analog cheap here is the shape of the game's own control
/// code. Turning, looking and walking are all velocity based, and every one of
/// them has the same three-branch form (found in the emitted C#, see NOTES):
///
///     if      (pad &amp; maskInc)  vel += rate >> 2, clamp to +rate
///     else if (pad &amp; maskDec)  vel -= rate >> 2, clamp to -rate
///     else                     vel decays toward 0
///     angle_or_position += vel
///
/// So the patch does not replace anything and does not touch the position. It
/// pre-loads the velocity word with `target - accel` and asserts the matching
/// button in the game's own pad global; the game's next instruction adds `accel`
/// and lands exactly on `target`, then applies it through its own path --
/// collision, the ±0x2BC pitch limit, the walk-speed normalisation, footsteps
/// and animation all run as they always did, on an amount we chose.
///
/// The buttons are read out of the game's action-mask table at 0x8006E568..5D0
/// rather than hardcoded, so it follows whatever the player set in the game's own
/// control-config screen.
///
/// Sticks idle == patch idle: the hooks return before touching anything, so the
/// D-pad and keyboard behave exactly as they do with <see cref="Enabled"/> off.
/// That is also why this can default to *on*: a keyboard player never reaches the
/// code at all, and a pad player without it has a left stick wired to the D-pad,
/// which in this game turns rather than walks. It lives in `patches/` rather than
/// `mods/` for the reason under "What belongs in a mod, and what does not":
/// working sticks on a modern pad are not a taste a player should have to find a
/// package to fix. See "Analog twin-stick control" in NOTES.md.
