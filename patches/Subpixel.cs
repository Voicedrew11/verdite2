/// <summary>
/// Sub-pixel vertex positioning — the fix for the wobbling, shimmering geometry
/// that is the other half of what makes a PlayStation picture recognisable.
///
///     KF2_SUBPIXEL=1             on; 0 or unset leaves it off
///     KF2_SUBPIXEL_PROBE=1       report how far vertices are actually moving
///
/// The GTE projects a vertex to 16.16 fixed point and then keeps only the whole
/// part: <c>SX2</c>/<c>SY2</c> are pixels, and the game copies those pixels into a
/// GP0 packet. So a vertex that should drift a twentieth of a pixel per frame sits
/// still for twenty frames and then jumps a whole one, and the polygon it belongs
/// to twitches and shears as its corners jump at different moments. Walk slowly
/// towards a wall and its edges crawl; that is the whole of it.
///
/// The fraction is not computed and lost, it is computed and *truncated* — the low
/// sixteen bits of the same expression <see cref="Perspective"/> takes the depth
/// from, one shift earlier. So it is caught in the same place and carried the same
/// way: <c>Gte.Rtp</c> hands (z, fx, fy) to <see cref="GteVertexMap"/> as the
/// coordinate leaves the GTE, the map follows the word into the primitive packet by
/// the address it is stored at, and the GPU asks for it again by the address it read
/// the word back from. The two halves share one map and one lookup and are switched
/// on independently.
///
/// Everything that makes the depth safe to recover makes the fraction safe too — a
/// miss leaves the vertex on the whole pixel the packet named, 2D never hits, and a
/// vertex that saturated off screen is still recorded for its depth so the polygon
/// can stay perspective-correct, but it stays on the clamp — moving it to the
/// GTE's true position opened holes along shared edges. One rule is deliberately
/// *not* carried over: correction is per vertex here, where W is all-or-nothing per
/// primitive. W is an interpolation parameter and one corner disagreeing about it
/// tears the texture across the whole triangle; a fraction is just where a corner
/// is. And because two triangles sharing a vertex read the same word out of the same
/// address, a shared edge keeps identical endpoints on both sides — no crack can open
/// along one.
///
/// Both renderers honour it. The hardware backend needed nothing at all: its vertex
/// position has been a float the whole time, so the fraction is simply added before
/// it is handed over. The software rasterizer did need something — it walks whole
/// pixels with integer edge functions — and now works in sixteenths of a pixel for
/// any triangle that recovered a fraction, which scales its edge functions and its
/// area by 256 and leaves every ratio taken from them identical. A triangle where
/// nothing was recovered runs at shift zero, which is the arithmetic it always did,
/// to the bit.
///
/// **Off by default**, unlike its sibling, and the reason is what has been measured
/// rather than any extra risk — the same "a miss is the old behaviour" argument
/// covers both. The mechanism is confirmed: 47k vertices a second recover a
/// fraction at a 90% hit rate, those fractions are spread evenly across the pixel
/// they were truncated from, and the frame rate does not move. What has *not* been
/// done is the picture: perspective correction became a default on the strength of
/// an ordering table drawn twice and the two frames differenced, and that pair has
/// not been taken for this. See "Sub-pixel vertex positioning" in NOTES.md.
///
/// As with perspective correction this patch is only the switch and the report; the
/// work is in the runtime (<c>patches/recompone/0010</c> and <c>0012</c>), because where a vertex
/// lands is decided far below anything <c>HookManager</c> can reach. The one hook is
/// on <c>DrawOTag</c>, purely to have a frame boundary to count against, and it is a
/// post-hook so it composes with the widescreen patch's replacement of the same
/// function.
