///
/// **The interesting part is not the SSAO, it is where the depth comes from.** The
/// PlayStation's GPU has no depth buffer and is handed none: the game sorts whole
/// polygons into an ordering table by their average OTZ and <c>DrawOTag</c> walks
/// it back to front. So there is no G-buffer to run a screen-space pass against,
/// and building one the usual way would mean a depth prepass — a second submission
/// of the frame's geometry, which this port cannot do, because the geometry arrives
/// incrementally through GP0 and nothing knows the frame is complete until it is.
///
/// The depth is recovered per vertex exactly as <see cref="Perspective"/> recovers
/// it, and then **painter's order does the rest**: with every 3D triangle writing
/// its depth and the test left at <c>GL_ALWAYS</c>, the last write at a pixel is
/// the last thing drawn there, which back to front is the nearest visible surface.
/// That is a correct visible-surface depth buffer arrived at with no depth test,
/// no prepass and no second pass over the geometry — and, because nothing is ever
/// rejected, with the ordering table still in sole charge of what is visible. This
/// is why it is not the Z-buffer: that one *tests*, and its picture has never come
/// out right (see "Z-buffer" in docs/RENDERING.md). Occlusion shading reads the
/// same numbers without letting them decide anything.
///
/// **What is not shaded is as load-bearing as what is.** Everything with no
/// recovered depth writes the *far plane* rather than the clip Z it used to, so the
/// HUD, the menus, the item pictures and any triangle the vertex map missed read as
/// "no surface here": they are neither shaded nor allowed to occlude anything, and
/// a hole in the depth buffer costs occlusion instead of inventing it. Semi-
/// transparent primitives write nothing at all, so a death fade or a damage flash
/// — which you see the world *through* — does not erase the world's depth
/// underneath it and does not make the shading blink off for the frames it covers.
///
/// **The normal is no longer a guess** (<c>0058</c>). It used to be a cross product
/// of four neighbouring depth texels, which straddles every silhouette and carries
/// the depth's quantisation into every flat wall — and this game is large flat
/// walls. The port assembles its own polygons and enumerates its own scene now, so
/// <c>AoGeometry</c> keeps the frame's depth-carrying triangles and the runtime
/// draws them again into a normal buffer once the frame is finished: a normal is
/// the polygon's own plane, exact and constant across the face. A pixel the buffer
/// did not reach keeps the old reconstruction, so it is additive.
/// <c>KF2_AO_NORMALS=0</c> is the comparison.
///
/// The pass runs at present, between the finished render target and the blit to
/// the window, and writes only its own texture. Nothing the game can read back
/// carries the shading: not VRAM, not either display buffer, and not the frame a
/// modal loop stores and restores — so a menu cannot bake it in and re-shade it
/// every iteration.
///
/// **On by default.** Every claim above is a mechanism with a counter behind it;
/// the picture has been judged for shipping. It is also deliberately not authentic:
/// the console could not have drawn this. Its switch is
/// under Video ▸ Enhancements with the others, and the tuning is on the console —
/// a radius and a strength are the port's question to answer, not the player's.
///
/// GL backend only. The work is in the runtime (<c>patches/recompone/0040</c>);
/// this is the switch and the report, and the one hook is a post on
/// <c>DrawOTag</c>, purely to have a frame boundary to count against.
