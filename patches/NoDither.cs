/// <summary>
/// Turns off the GPU's ordered dither — the 4x4 crosshatch that sits over every
/// shaded surface in the game.
///
///     KF2_NODITHER_PROBE=1   also report the two draw-mode sources to the console
///
/// It is a setting, under Video — see Kf2.Settings.NoDitherPage. The saved
/// choice is read on RuntimeReadyEvent rather than in <see cref="Configure"/>,
/// since ConfigManager only loads inside HostWindow.Initialize, after Program.cs.
///
/// The PlayStation frame buffer is 15-bit, so the GPU has to drop the low three
/// bits of each 8-bit colour component on the way in. With the dither bit set it
/// first adds a bias from a 4x4 table indexed by the pixel's own coordinates, so
/// the truncation error alternates per pixel and a gradient reads as a texture of
/// tiny checkers instead of as bands. Clearing the bit skips the bias: the same
/// quantization happens, straight, and gradients band instead. That trade is the
/// whole of this patch — there is no third option at 15 bits.
///
/// The runtime honours the bit on both render paths, so nothing here is
/// backend-specific: the software rasterizer adds the table entry in
/// <c>GpuRaster.Plot</c>, and the hardware backend packs it into the vertex
/// texpage word and applies it in <c>quant5</c> in the fragment shader. Both read
/// one piece of GPU state, <c>_dither</c>, and that is set from exactly one place:
/// bit 9 of a GP0(E1) draw-mode word. So "remove the dithering" means "make sure
/// no E1 word with bit 9 set ever reaches the GPU", and two of the three ways one
/// gets there are hookable:
///
///   * **PutDrawEnv**, from the <c>dtd</c> flag at <c>DRAWENV+0x16</c>. The
///     library turns that byte straight into bit 9 of the E1 word it sends. This
///     is the one this game uses, and it uses only this one: the counter below
///     measures exactly one dithered draw env per frame — so one per rendered
///     frame, 30 a second when that was measured at 30 fps — on the title screen
///     and in `fdat02` alike.
///   * **A DR_MODE or DR_TPAGE packet in the ordering table**, which is an E1
///     word the game linked in among the primitives. <c>SetDrawTPage</c> builds
///     one with the bit clear, <c>SetDrawMode</c> can build one with it set.
///     Measured over the same two, this game emits none at all — that counter
///     stays at zero — but the scan is cheap, it only writes when it finds one,
///     and a mid-OT E1 would silently undo the first hook for the rest of the
///     frame. So it is covered rather than assumed away.
///
/// The third way is the parts of libgpu that are still recompiled MIPS, writing
/// GP0 through the register <c>PSMemory</c> traps. Nothing here can hook that, so
/// it is checked rather than intercepted: GPUSTAT bit 9 is the state both
/// renderers actually read, and <c>KF2_NODITHER_PROBE=1</c> samples it after each
/// frame is drawn. It reading back 0 for a whole session is what says nothing took
/// that route — without it, "both hooks fire" would only be evidence about the two
/// routes that were already known about.
///
/// Neither hooked route is rewritten, only borrowed: the <c>dtd</c> byte and any
/// E1 word found are cleared in the pre-hook and put back in the post-hook, so the
/// game's own memory is identical either side of the call and switching the
/// setting off leaves nothing behind. That matters for the packet buffer
/// especially — some of it is built once and re-sent for the rest of the run, so a
/// bit cleared in place would stay cleared long after the setting was turned off.
///
/// The ordering-table scan is a word-level walk rather than a search for bytes
/// that look like E1: a colour or a vertex word can perfectly well have 0xE1 in
/// its top byte, and clearing bit 9 of a coordinate would move geometry. So the
/// scan steps command by command using the GP0 command lengths, and stops at the
/// two commands whose length it cannot know without more state (a polyline, and an
/// image load followed by raw pixel data). Neither appears in this game's ordering
/// tables.
///
/// <see cref="Enabled"/> is live rather than fixed at startup, so the two pictures
/// can be compared without a restart; the hooks stay attached and do nothing.
///
/// It is a pre/post hook and not a replacement on purpose. <c>HookManager</c>
/// allows one <c>Replace</c> owner per function and the widescreen patch owns
/// <c>DrawOTag</c>; pre- and post-hooks compose with a replacement and with each
/// other, so this, that patch and the frame pacing's own post-hook all coexist.
