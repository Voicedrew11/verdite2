/// <summary>
/// **The Input pane, drawn by the port rather than extended by it.**
///
/// Every other patch page joins a section through
/// <c>SettingsRegistry.Extend</c>, which appends after that section's own body.
/// For Video and Gameplay that is exactly right. For Input it was not: the
/// runtime's own pane is two tab bars, a sixteen-row binding table and a reset
/// button — about 450px of a 500px popup — so the port's four pages landed
/// *below the fold*, in an order nobody chose (none of them set
/// <c>Order</c>, so they sorted on the title ordinal and the map's pad binding
/// came out between the keyboard layout and mouse look). Worse than the
/// scrolling, the two keyboard-layout buttons write the sixteen rows of a table
/// a screen above them, and the stick settings were nowhere near the pad one.
///
/// <c>docs/INPUT.md</c> weighed this exact wrapper and **rejected** it, in favour
/// of a <c>controls</c> section of the port's own beside Input. That is reversed
/// here on a fact nobody had checked: <c>settings.input</c> already renders
/// **"Controles" in pt-BR *and* es-419**, so a second sidebar entry called
/// Controls collides head-on with the Input pane's own name in two of the three
/// languages. The general finding is worth more than this instance — *a new
/// sidebar entry has to be checked against every language of the ones already
/// there, not just English.* Splitting the pane could not have delivered the
/// point of the exercise anyway, since the layout buttons have to sit with the
/// table they write.
///
/// The old objection stands and is now a cost being paid rather than an argument
/// that lost: the port owns a section the runtime registers, in a checkout that
/// is gitignored and moves under us. What pays it is that the wrapper is cheap
/// to abandon — deleting one <c>Register</c> line in <see cref="PatchSettings"/>
/// restores the runtime's pane exactly — and that the copied half
/// (<see cref="BindingTable"/>) names its source so a pin bump has something to
/// diff.
///
/// **`Register` replaces by id, and that is the whole mechanism.**
/// <c>SettingsRegistry.Register</c> does <c>RemoveAll(s =&gt; s.Id == section.Id)</c>
/// and then adds, so registering this on <c>RuntimeReadyEvent</c> — after
/// <c>HostWindow.Load</c> has registered the runtime's five — takes the pane
/// over. Do **not** <c>Unregister("input")</c> first: it states removal where the
/// intent is substitution, and it hides the one failure that matters — if
/// upstream ever renames the id, an unregister no-ops silently and the register
/// adds a *second* Input tab. <see cref="PatchSettings"/> warns on that directly
/// instead.
///
/// **The four pages had to leave the registry, not just be reordered in it.**
/// <c>SettingsPopup</c> draws <c>current.Draw()</c> and then every
/// <c>GetExtensions(current.Id)</c>, and <c>SettingsRegistry</c> has
/// <c>Extend</c> with no un-extend — the list is append-only with no removal API
/// — so a page still registered against <c>"input"</c> would draw a second time
/// under the tab bar, outside every tab, permanently. So the registrations are
/// dropped from <c>PatchSettings.Install</c> and this class holds the instances.
///
/// <c>IPatchPage.Order</c> is inert for a page drawn here (the sequence is
/// written out below, so there is no list to sort) and <c>Title</c> keeps only
/// its degenerate half: an empty title declines the heading, which is what a
/// page alone in a tab that already names it wants.
