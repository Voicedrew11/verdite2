/// knob was an environment variable read once at startup. That is the real cost
/// of moving something out of <c>mods/</c> and into <c>patches/</c>: the code
/// keeps working and the whole panel disappears.
///
/// The replacement is not a panel of our own. <c>SettingsRegistry.Extend</c> takes
/// a section id and a draw callback and runs it after that section's own content,
/// so a patch's settings can go where a user would already look for them -- the
/// frame rate belongs under Video, beside vsync and render scale, and not in a
/// King's Field box off to one side. A patch registers a page against a section:
///
/// <code>
/// PatchSettings.Register("display", new FramePacingPage());
/// </code>
///
/// The section ids are the runtime's own: <c>interface</c>, <c>display</c>,
/// <c>paths</c>, <c>audio</c> — plus <c>gameplay</c>, the one section the port
/// adds itself (see <see cref="GameplaySection"/>), for patches that change how
/// the game plays rather than how the machine behaves. An id that matches no
/// section is reported at startup rather than silently drawing nothing.
///
/// <c>input</c> is not on that list any more, and it is the other way the port can
/// own a pane: <see cref="InputSection"/> **replaces** the runtime's section
/// rather than extending it, because <c>Extend</c> can only append and the
/// runtime's own Input body fills the popup. Registering a page against
/// <c>"input"</c> is refused with a message, since <c>Extend</c> has no un-extend
/// and such a page would draw outside every tab forever.
///
/// Settings persist through <see cref="Set(string,bool)"/> and friends, which is
/// <c>Runtime.View</c> plus an immediate <c>SaveView</c> -- the same
/// <c>interface.ini</c> store the mods use -- keyed <c>kf2.&lt;patch&gt;.&lt;name&gt;</c>.
/// Note that <c>ConfigManager.Load()</c> runs inside <c>HostWindow.Initialize</c>,
/// i.e. **after** Program.cs: a patch that wants a persisted default has to read
/// it on <c>RuntimeReadyEvent</c> and not in its own <c>Configure</c>, or it will
/// read a fresh empty config and then overwrite the file with it.
