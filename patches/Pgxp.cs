/// **The port has two mechanisms for one number and this is the switch between

/// position and view depth, before the GTE truncated the first and discarded the
/// second — and both answer it in the only place the two are ever in hand at once,
/// <c>Gte.Rtp</c>. What differs is how the answer is carried from there to the GP0
/// packet the GPU actually draws:
///
///   * <see cref="GteVertexMap"/> (<c>patches/recompone/0012</c>) watches
///     <c>PSMemory</c>'s word reads and writes and pairs them by value in a small
///     ring. It needs no recompile, and it is a guess about registers made without
///     being able to see any: a coordinate the game <em>computes</em> rather than
///     copies is lost, and a lost vertex is a polygon with no depth.
///   * PGXP (upstream RecompOne, backported as <c>0034</c>–<c>0036</c>) tracks the
///     value through the registers themselves, with hooks the recompiler emits
///     beside every load, store, move, shift, add and multiply. Nothing is
///     inferred, so the coverage is not a rate that happens to be high — it is
///     every path the value can take.
///
/// **Coverage was the reason this was taken and coverage is not what it bought.**
/// Measured in area 2 at 144 fps, over eight windows each: the address map answers
/// for 92.2-97.1% of vertices and PGXP for 93.4-96.7%, which is the same number.
/// King's Field assembles its packets with whole-word <c>lw</c>/<c>sw</c> out of a
/// transform cache — the one shape a value-matching ring follows perfectly — so
/// there was very little for register tracking to find. What it costs is real:
/// **144.0 fps against 106.7-114.9**, all of it in the emitted hooks
/// (<c>KF2_PGXP_CPU=0</c> reads 144.0 again, and 79.2-85.7% coverage from the
/// screen-position cache alone, since <c>PgxpMemory.Store</c> is only ever reached
/// from <c>PgxpCpu</c>).
///
/// **It is off, not off-by-default, and it has no control in the settings
/// window.** A mechanism whose picture nobody has judged, which buys no coverage
/// here and costs a fifth of the frame rate, is a comparison rather than a
/// setting -- so it went the way the map's style and the widescreen ticks went,
/// out of the pane and onto the console. <c>KF2_PGXP=1</c> is the only way in and
/// the saved key is no longer read, so a config that ticked it while upstream's
/// PGXP block was drawn is not left running slow with nothing to explain it.
///
/// It is kept, for what it has that the ring cannot:
/// backface culling decided on precise positions rather than truncated ones, a
/// projection in floats rather than a recovered fraction, and coverage that is a
/// property of the mechanism instead of a rate that happens to be high for this
/// game's packet assembly. **The number that actually fixed the Z-buffer was the
/// clip W** (see <c>GpuHleForward.HleTri</c>), and that helps both sources.
