/// Renders the game wider than its 320-pixel screen.
///
///     KF2_WIDESCREEN=16:9       aspect for the run; "1.777" and "off" also parse
///     KF2_WIDESCREEN_PROBE=1    the margin census, on the console
///     KF2_WIDESCREEN_PROBE=2    the census plus every wide primitive, once per shape
///     KF2_WIDESCREEN_EFFECTS=0  leave the death fade and the damage flash 320 wide
///
/// It is a setting, under Video — see Kf2.Settings.WidescreenPage. The saved
/// aspect is read on RuntimeReadyEvent rather than in <see cref="Configure"/>,
/// since ConfigManager only loads inside HostWindow.Initialize, after Program.cs.
///
/// The runtime already knows how to do this: a display buffer is drawn into a
/// render target that carries a margin of extra columns either side
/// (<c>GpuHle.WideMargin</c>), only the original 320 are written back to VRAM, and
/// the whole widened target is presented at <c>Display.WideAspect</c>. Setting
/// that one number is the whole hookup — 16:9 gives 54 columns a side.
///
/// What that buys depends entirely on the game, and this is the distinction worth
/// keeping straight:
///
///   * It is *not* a stretch. The projection is untouched, so pixels keep their
///     aspect and the HUD is drawn at its authored size, sitting inset from the
///     new edges rather than smeared 33% wide across them.
///   * The extra picture is real only where the game submits geometry it expects
///     the GPU to clip. Anything the game culls itself, against its own idea of
///     the screen, never reaches the margin however wide the target is.
///
/// So this carries its own evidence: <c>KF2_WIDESCREEN_PROBE=1</c> classifies
/// every primitive by whether any vertex falls outside the game's own clip
/// rectangle. Measured in the first area (`fdat02`), it is **a quarter** — 25.4%
/// and 25.1% of about 1,000 primitives a frame in consecutive windows, and 22-25%
/// on the title screen. King's Field culls per object and by depth and leaves the
/// screen edge to the GPU, so a quarter of every frame it draws was being thrown
/// away at x=0 and x=319. That is the picture the margin recovers, and it is why
/// this is worth doing on this game specifically.
///
/// The census is the thing to look at if a scene looks wrong at the sides. The
/// GAME.EXE menus measure 0.0% — they are 2D, authored 320 wide, and no aspect
/// will widen them; what the sides show there is whatever the frame's background
/// clear covered, since PutDrawEnv extends an `isbg` clear across the margin but
/// nothing extends a full-screen rectangle the game drew itself.
///
/// ## The screen-space tints
///
/// That last sentence was a real defect, not a footnote: the death fade and the
/// damage flash blacked out and reddened the middle of the picture only, with the
/// world carrying on brightly in the margins. The game draws every whole-screen
/// effect the same way — <c>func_8003220C</c> leaves a blend mode and a colour in a
/// request block, <c>func_8003214C</c> reads it once a frame and submits
/// <c>func_80031EE8(0, 0, 320, 240)</c>, a flat semi-transparent POLY_FT4 at the
/// front of the ordering table whose tpage carries the mode (subtractive for the
/// fade, additive for a flash). <see cref="Stretch"/> widens that quad, keyed on
/// its shape rather than on the drawer's address so that OPEN.EXE's and END.EXE's
/// own links of it need no addresses of their own. See "The screen-space effects
/// are 320 wide too" in NOTES.md.
///
/// ## Why a patch, and why it is still off by default
///
/// It is a patch for the reason the dither switch is one: an aspect ratio is a
/// picture the port should be able to offer without a package having to load, and
/// a player looking for it will look in Video, not in a Mods popup. That is an
/// argument about *where the switch lives*, and it is the whole argument — it
/// says nothing about which way the switch should point.
///
/// Which way it points is the sub-pixel argument rather than the dither one: the
/// mechanism has been measured and the picture has not. The census says a quarter
/// of the frame is there to recover; what has never been checked by eye is the two
/// places it can go wrong — a full-screen rectangle the game draws itself is 320
/// wide and leaves the sides showing the previous frame, and per-object culling
/// still uses the game's own 4:3 frustum, so an object can pop at an edge the
/// margin would have shown it in. Neither is visible to a primitive counter. So
/// the default aspect is 4:3, which is <c>WideAspect = 0</c> and the untouched
/// path, and the presets are one click away in the combo Video draws below the
/// render scale. See "Widescreen" in NOTES.md.
///
/// ## Anchoring the HUD
///
/// The world gets wider; the HUD does not, because it is drawn in screen space
/// and screen space is still 320 wide. Left alone it sits inset from the new
/// edges, hugging the 4:3 box it was authored in. Anchoring moves each element to
/// the edge it belongs to — which needs a way to tell a HUD primitive from a
/// world one, and the primitive stream carries no such flag.
///
/// Two measurements, both in `fdat02`, say what it is and what it is not:
///
///   * **Where the HUD is.** Whole-frame dumps put it in two fixed clusters —
///     x 5..91 for the HP/MP panel, x 269..310 for the equipment icons, both at
///     y 11..60 — and always in the **last ordering-table entries**, from about
///     65 from the end. That is the front of the OT, which is where a painter's
///     algorithm has to put anything that goes on top.
///   * **What it is not: the palette.** Every HUD primitive in that first dump
///     used a CLUT in VRAM column 0, and no world primitive in that frame did,
///     which looked like a clean test and is not one: walking further into the
///     area finds world geometry using column-0 palettes all the way back through
///     the OT. Anchoring on that rule shifted half the world sideways by exactly
///     the margin — 54-pixel wedges of missing floor and ceiling, which is what
///     the artefact looks like when a rule like this is wrong.
///
/// So the test is structural and positional, not palette-based: a primitive is
/// HUD if it is in the last <see cref="HudTailEntries"/> ordering-table entries
/// *and* its box falls inside one of the two clusters. The OT gate is why this
/// replaces <c>DrawOTag</c> and walks the table itself — the primitive event
/// cannot say which entry a primitive came from. Being wrong now costs one small
/// triangle in a corner rather than the whole frame after it.
///
/// Each HUD primitive then moves to its own side: entirely left of screen centre
/// moves out by the margin, entirely right moves out the other way, and anything
/// straddling the middle is left where it is, which is where centred text and
/// full-width elements want to be.
///
/// ## What it costs at 4:3
///
/// Nothing that runs per primitive, which is what makes the default-off case free
/// rather than merely cheap. The replacement's two-pass walk and the
/// <c>RenderPrimEvent</c> listener are both gated on the margin actually being
/// non-zero: with no margin the replacement is a straight call to the original and
/// no listener is attached at all, so <c>GpuRaster</c> skips the whole dispatch on
/// <c>HasAnyListeners</c>. The hooks are still installed, because a hook cannot be
/// added once the game is running past its overlay loads and the aspect is a
/// setting that can be changed mid-session.
