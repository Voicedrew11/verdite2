///     KF2_KEYS=fps      force this layout on (the default for a fresh install)
///     KF2_KEYS=stock    leave RecompOne's Z X A S Q W E R F G alone
///
/// RecompOne's defaults are a *console's* defaults spelled on a keyboard — the
/// face buttons on Z X A S, the shoulders on Q W E R, the D-pad on the arrows.
/// That is the right generic answer for a machine that has to run any PS1 game,
/// and it is the wrong answer for this one, because the D-pad in King's Field
/// walks *and turns*: the arrows alone are a tank control, and a mouse in the
/// other hand has nothing sensible to do.
///
/// Read through the game's own action-mask table (see "The action-mask table" in
/// NOTES.md), what the pad buttons mean here is:
///
///     Up / Down     walk forward / back        L1 / R1   strafe left / right
///     Left / Right  turn                       L2 / R2   look up / down
///     Square attack                            Circle    the in-game menu
///     Cross  the action button: use, open      Triangle  cast
///
/// which rearranges into the layout every first-person game has used since
/// Quake:
///
///     W A S D   walk and strafe          mouse   turn and look
///     arrows    walk and turn
///     Space     attack        F  use     Q  cast     Tab  menu
///     mouse     left attacks, right casts, middle uses
///
/// The arrows keep walking as well as turning, and that is not nostalgia: the
/// game's menus are navigated with the same D-pad bits, so an arrow key that no
/// longer presses Up would leave the in-game menu going up and down on W and S.
/// The runtime's binding table holds one key per button, so the second binding
/// cannot live there — see <see cref="Extras"/>.
///
/// Two things about how this is applied are deliberate.
///
/// **A fresh install gets it as a default, not as an override.**
/// <see cref="Configure"/> runs from Program.cs, *before* ConfigManager.Load, and
/// Load writes the object it finds in memory when there is no settings.json to
/// read. So on a first run this is simply what the port's defaults are, and on
/// every run after it the player's own file wins — the same relationship
/// RecompOne's defaults have with it.
///
/// **An existing install is migrated once, and only from stock.** Anyone who
/// already ran the port has a settings.json full of RecompOne's defaults, and a
/// default that only reaches new installs is not much of a default.
/// <see cref="Install"/> therefore rewrites those bindings once — but only if
/// they are *exactly* the stock ones, so a single key someone chose for
/// themselves stops it, and it records that it has run so that deliberately
/// going back to stock is not undone on the next launch.
///
/// The runtime's own "Reset to defaults" button under Input still resets to
/// RecompOne's scheme; <see cref="Kf2.Settings.KeyLayoutPage"/> is the button
/// that puts this one back.
