/// <summary>
/// What each drawn frame's ordering table actually got, across an area crossing.
///
///     KF2_CROSSPROBE=1  a per-frame dump around every fdat load
///
/// ## Why luminance could not answer this
///
/// A crossing was reported as "a moment of darkness or at least not the correct
/// frame", on **every** crossing, and with the appearance varying between them.
/// `BlackProbe` asks whether a frame is *dark*, which at a door into an unlit
/// corridor is the room and not the defect: both arms of the CD-pump A/B
/// reported the same one-frame `[black] flash` lines at luminance 3 on both
/// buffers. Two fixes were then aimed at a defect no counter could see.
///
/// The captured artifact is **HUD present, world absent**, and that is countable
/// without looking at a pixel. `TileWalk.CellsDrawn` is the map the last walk
/// submitted and `ModelWalk.Scene` is every model it submitted, so a frame that
/// drew 0 of ~200 cells is named in a pitch-black corridor exactly as it is in
/// daylight.
///
/// ## What it samples
///
/// **A post on `DrawOTag`, not on the renderer.** Sampling in the renderer's own
/// post can only ever see frames the renderer built, so a presented frame it did
/// not build is structurally invisible -- and that is one of the things worth
/// knowing. Each sample carries `built`: whether `func_800342D8` ran between this
/// `DrawOTag` and the previous one. Into a ring:
/// the time, whether the frame was a tick (`FramePacing.TickedThisFrame` — the
/// gated stages ran) or a between-tick redraw, cells walked, cells drawn, models
/// submitted, the area byte, and the view the frame was drawn from. An `fdat` load
/// marks the ring; the window from <see cref="BeforeMs"/> before it to
/// <see cref="AfterMs"/> after is dumped, one character per frame, with the census
/// underneath.
///
/// The view is in there because **"no world" is only one of the three ways a
/// crossing frame can be wrong**, and the other two are invisible to a cell count:
/// the right number of tiles from the *wrong area*, and the right world from the
/// *wrong camera*. The area byte names the first; a frame whose view jumps and
/// comes back names the second, which is what a between-tick redraw of a world
/// halfway through being replaced would look like — and it would look slightly
/// different every crossing, which is what play reports.
///
/// Diagnostic only, off by default. It allocates nothing per frame and reads two
/// longs and a span length.
