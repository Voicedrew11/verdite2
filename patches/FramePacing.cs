///                     the stages to tick at LogicHz -- naming any replaces the set

/// It is also a setting, under Video -- see Kf2.Settings.FramePacingPage. The
/// saved choice is read on RuntimeReadyEvent rather than in Configure, since
/// ConfigManager only loads inside HostWindow.Initialize, after Program.cs; the

///
/// King's Field's speed *is* its frame rate -- everything advances a fixed amount
/// per loop iteration -- so a port that draws more often has to decide what to do
/// about that, and this is where that decision lives.
///
/// ## What used to hold the port at 30, and why none of it does now
///
/// Three separate gates, and they are worth keeping straight because only the
/// first is the game's:
///
/// 1. **The game's own frame gate, `func_80017880`.** Stage 13 (the renderer)
///    ends by calling it. It spins on a vblank credit at 0x801B6CA8 -- bumped by
///    the game's own vblank callback, `func_80017850` -- until the credit reaches
///    **2**, then zeroes it. That literal 2 is the game's frame rate, in software.
///    Since patches/recompone/0021 ticks the emulated vblank on a wall-clock 60 Hz
///    grid, this alone paces the port to exactly 30 fps whatever the host does.
///    **<see cref="BeforeFrameGate"/> now skips it at every rate, not only above
///    30**, because the rate the world is held to is no longer the rate that
///    literal asks for -- see below.
/// 2. **RecompOne's FrameClock**, which used to be a hard-coded 60 Hz applied per
///    *VSync call*. patches/recompone/0025 makes it settable; this class sets it
///    as a permissive ceiling rather than as the pacer, because a frame can carry
///    more than one VSync call and a per-call throttle therefore cannot express a
///    frame rate.
/// 3. **<see cref="Floor"/>**, below -- the port's own deadline at the frame
///    boundary, which is the only one of the three that knows where a frame ends,
///    and now the only thing pacing the picture at any rate.
///
/// With the game's gate gone a rendered frame carries **exactly one VSync call**
/// at every rate -- the presenter's, `func_8002E0FC`, which does VSync(0)
/// immediately before its DrawOTag. The gate's spin calls were the second one.
/// That makes the frame boundary in <see cref="AfterDrawOTag"/> the same shape at
/// 20 fps as at 144.
///
/// ## The logic clock
///
/// The game's gate is removed and the loop runs at whatever the floor allows -- so
/// the world would advance a fixed amount that many times a second.
/// The fix is a fixed timestep: a wall-clock accumulator ticks at
/// <see cref="LogicHz"/>, and the main-loop stages that hold per-tick state run
/// only on a frame where it ticked. **The accumulator is the only thing holding
/// the world to a rate now**, which is why it runs in every configuration,
/// including uncapped and including a render rate below the tick rate. Everything the game counts in frames -- the
/// death sequence, spell lifetimes, buff timers, the poison tick, entity AI --
/// then keeps hardware timing exactly, at any rate.
///
/// What is gated is everything found to hold per-tick state that cannot draw:
///
///     2  func_80037C0C   the object-table state machine: 396 slots of 0x44 at
///                        0x80177714, dispatched on the type byte at rec+0x4
///                        through a 224-entry jump table at 0x8001191C. Every
///                        world prop that moves is in here -- doors, the
///                        drawbridge, the minecart, the crystals -- and it writes
///                        their position VECTOR itself, so ungated they moved at
///                        the render rate
///     3  func_8002A550   pad read, turn, walk, angle fold, the death counter at
///                        0x8019951A, the poison tick, the buff timers at
///                        0x80199472..0x80199482, and 0x80199488, the global frame
///                        counter it bumps last
///     4  func_80040348   the 200-record entity table at 0x8016C544. Its AI runs
///                        one entity in four off 0x80175908 &amp; 3, which stays
///                        right for free once the stage itself is gated
///     5  func_80046A60   128 effect/projectile slots at 0x8019CC6C, each with a
///                        lifetime at rec+0x0E decremented once per call. Ungated,
///                        every spell and effect expires at the render rate
///     6  func_8004910C   the area module's per-frame entry, slot 1 of the module
///                        header, reached as *(u32*)(*(u32*)0x8017E068 + 4). Six

///     13 func_80033FBC   the fade state machine stage 13 calls -- state byte
///                        0x80192D42, brightness 0x80192D44 stepping +0x14 in and
///                        -0x14 out, hold counter 0x80192D43. Its own subtree is
///                        three functions and none can draw, so the fade is gated
///                        even though its caller is the renderer
///     13 func_8002DC78   the animated-texture updater stage 13 calls -- eight
///                        slots at 0x80192D58 (stride 0x18), each a scroll phase at
///                        rec+0x4 re-uploaded to VRAM through func_80060624. The
///                        water, the fire and the creatures' skins. Its subtree is
///                        the VRAM upload alone, so like the fade it is gated though
///                        its caller draws; ungated it scrolled at the render rate
///
/// **Can it draw** is the test each of those had to pass, because a stage that
/// submits primitives cannot be skipped -- at 120 fps three frames in four would
/// have nothing from it. That is checked against the emitted C#: the subtree of a
/// gated function must contain no `DrawOTag`, `VSync`, `PutDispEnv` or
/// `PutDrawEnv`. **Stages 2 and 3 are the two exceptions and they are the same
/// shape**: what they reach is **stage 13 itself**, not a drawing primitive of
/// their own. Stage 3 gets there through `func_80029CBC -> func_80018E80` (the
/// in-game menu) and `func_80037B5C` (the transition fade), both of which take
/// the main loop over and render their own frames, and through `func_80022DC4`
/// (the menu blip) which VSyncs without drawing. Stage 2's case is strictly
/// narrower: enumerating every function in its subtree that calls a submitting or
/// presenting entry point directly leaves exactly one, reached by exactly one
/// edge -- `func_80037C0C -> func_80037B5C -> func_800342D8 -> func_8002E0FC` --
/// plus the area modules' own message-box and cutscene loops (`func_80047000`,
/// `func_80048208`, `func_8004831C`) off its indirect arm, which reach stage 13
/// the same way. Those are *extra* renders inside the stage rather than the
/// frame's own: the main loop still runs stage 13 afterwards, so skipping either
/// stage costs a redundant draw and not a frame's picture. Skipping decides
/// whether such a loop is entered; it cannot cut one in half, since once entered
/// the stage is on the stack and drives its own frames. The cost is that entering
/// a fade or a cutscene can be deferred by up to one tick. (`scripts/check_gate.py`
/// re-derives this; both are recorded exceptions there, and the single-path
/// version of the stage 3 sentence was wrong.)
///
/// **What this still does not cover, stated rather than discovered later.**
/// Stage 13's **jitter accumulator at 0x8006E608** is in stage 13's own body
/// rather than in a callee, so no hook can reach it -- it is a damped accumulator
/// (decayed by an eighth a call) driving the screen shake, so above the tick rate
/// it settles faster and smaller. **The modal loops are covered, and not by this
/// class**: `func_80037B5C` (the transition fade), the item-use and spell-cast
/// animations and the menu all step once per *rendered* frame inside a loop of
/// their own, which a gate cannot reach because it decides only whether such a
/// loop is entered. <see cref="LoopPacing"/> holds the loop's *body* to one run per
/// tick instead, and fills the gap between its iterations by **redrawing** -- stage
/// 13 called again, with the two view pointers the loop itself passed it, at the
/// phase the frame now stands at. The world then advances at <see cref="LogicHz"/>
/// while the picture is drawn at the render rate, with the smoothing carrying it.
/// And **the object
/// record's rec+0x40 on two slots survived gating stage 2 at ratio 3.69**: that
/// one is stepped by stage 13's own object pass `func_800331B4` (proved by gating
/// it as a probe -- 53.4/s fell to 17.6/s), where it is an ambient-sound retrigger
/// deadline in vblank units against 0x801B6CAC. `func_800331B4` steps the timer
/// and draws the models in one loop, so no whole-function hook separates them.
///
/// The camera would then move <see cref="LogicHz"/> times a second while the
/// picture updated more often, which looks worse than not drawing faster at all. <see cref="FrameSmoothing"/> is the
/// other half of this and carries the view between ticks.
///
/// This lives in `patches/` and not in `mods/` on purpose. It is a correctness
/// fix that has to be on: shipping it as a runtime-loaded package would let it be
/// absent, disabled or fail to compile, and the failure would look like the game
/// simply running too fast. The genuinely optional extras are real mods -- see
