/// Can a primitive be recognised in the previous tick's display list?
///
///     KF2_PACKETMATCH=1   the match census, once a second
///     KF2_PACKETMATCH=2   also list the worst-matching contexts
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// Everything the port smooths between logic ticks, it smooths by *table*:
/// <see cref="FrameSmoothing"/> carries the camera, <see cref="ObjectSmoothing"/>
/// carries four model tables plus the entity records. That approach has been
/// incomplete three times running, and each miss was found the same way -- a
/// person noticing a stepping door, a stepping crystal, a drawbridge that turned
/// out not to be a model at all -- then a round trip to find the table it came
/// from. See item 6 in `docs/TODO.md`.
///
/// The alternative is to stop enumerating tables and work one layer down: at
/// `DrawOTag` the frame is a list of finished primitives, and if the *same*
/// primitive can be recognised in the previous tick's list then its screen
/// position can be carried by the tick phase. That would be one hook covering
/// doors, tiles, enemies, the drawbridge and the animated-texture scroll alike.
///
/// **Whether it can be recognised is the whole question, and this file only
/// measures it.** Nothing here writes to game memory and nothing here changes a
/// picture; it prints a line, like every other probe in the port.
///
/// ## Where it measures
///
/// A read-only **pre-hook on `DrawOTag`**, walking the ordering table the same way
/// `Widescreen`'s replacement does. That layer sees the whole packet -- command
/// word, every vertex, every UV, every colour -- and each word's address in the
/// primitive arena, which `RenderPrimEvent` does not: that event carries four
/// screen positions and four flags and nothing else, so the intrinsic key below
/// could not be measured from it without first patching the checkout.
///
/// `HookManager` allows one `Replace` owner per function and any number of
/// pre-hooks, and runs all pres before the replacement, so this composes with
/// Widescreen's replacement and with NoDither's, Perspective's and Subpixel's
/// pairs on the same three addresses.
///
/// ## What a primitive is attributed to
///
/// A key needs to name a *thing in the world*, not a position in the stream, or
/// one extra polygon anywhere shifts every key after it. The identity is already
/// in the arguments of the two routines that submit geometry:
///
/// * `func_80032588` -- the model submitter. Its `a2` is the position pointer,
///   `base + slot*stride + posOff`, which is a stable per-slot name across frames
///   and covers all four model tables at once.
/// * `func_80031950` -- the map-tile submitter. Its `a0` is the tile record
///   address **plus the half offset** (`S0` or `S0+5` in `func_80031B1C`), so it
///   already distinguishes a tile's two drawn halves and needs no counter.
///
/// Which packets belong to which is read off the primitive arena, exactly as
/// <see cref="DrawCensus"/> attributes bytes: the game bumps a `{start,end,cur}`
/// descriptor at `0x8017E0A4` once per polygon, so the packets a call produced are
/// the addresses between its entry and exit `cur`. Everything outside both
/// routines -- the HUD, the 2D arm, the screen tints -- is context `other`, and is
/// reported separately because it is not what would be interpolated.
///
/// ## The three keys, and why three
///
/// The hypothesis most likely to be false is that a primitive's **ordinal** within
/// its object is stable. Back-face culling submits only the faces pointing at you,
/// so as the camera turns the number of polygons a slot emits changes and every
/// ordinal after the change shifts by one -- the key would break exactly when
/// motion is most visible. So the run measures the fallback at the same time:
///
/// * **K1, ordinal** -- `(kind, contextId, index within context)`, the obvious key.
/// * **K2, lerpable** -- K1 matched *and* the same primitive shape (vertex count,
///   textured/gouraud/semi/raw). A match that changed shape cannot be carried.
/// * **K3, intrinsic** -- `(kind, contextId, hash of the command byte, the UVs and
///   the CLUT/texpage)`. A rigid model's face has fixed texture coordinates
///   whatever order it is emitted in, so this key does not care about culling. Its
///   risk is the opposite one -- a corridor of identical tiles reusing a UV set --
///   so **collisions are counted**, because a key that is not unique is not a key.
///
///   **Vertex colours are deliberately not in it.** They were at first, and the
///   key read 0-5% on the world against 92-99% for the ordinal, which is not a
///   weak key but a broken one: the colours are the game's own per-frame shading,
///   recomputed as the camera moves, so a face never hashed the same twice. The
///   HUD, whose colours are constant, was the only thing that matched -- which is
///   what named the cause. What is left is the geometry's identity and nothing
///   about its appearance.
///
///   An untextured primitive therefore has **no intrinsic key at all**, and is
///   counted as such rather than as a miss: `no key` in the report is the fraction
///   of the frame this scheme could never address, and it is part of the answer.
///
/// ## Two kinds of miss, and only one of them matters
///
/// A primitive can go unmatched for two completely different reasons, and averaging
/// them together answers nothing:
///
/// * **Its object was not on screen last tick.** Something walked into view, or a
///   tile entered the visibility grid. No scheme can carry a thing that did not
///   exist to be carried, and drawing it where the game put it is correct.
/// * **Its object *was* on screen and the key still missed.** That is the key
///   breaking -- the back-face-culling case -- and it is fatal, because it happens
///   to a thing the player is already looking at.
///
/// So the report gives K1 and K3 twice: over everything, and over the primitives
/// whose context was present in the previous tick as well (`surviving`). **The
/// second number is the one that decides this design.**
///
/// ## Is there anything to carry? The `pose` column
///
/// A matched primitive's screen displacement is not all animation. Split per
/// context, it is two things:
///
/// * **The context's mean** -- every primitive of an object moving together. That is
///   the camera's motion plus the object's own translation, and both are already
///   carried, by <see cref="FrameSmoothing"/> and <see cref="ObjectSmoothing"/>. A
///   packet smoother that carried this too would add the camera a second time and
///   throw objects ahead of the world on every turn.
/// * **The deviation from that mean** -- primitives of one object moving *relative
///   to each other*. That is pose change, and it is the only thing left for a
///   packet-level smoother to recover.
///
/// So `pose` is the mean deviation, in pixels a tick, over matched primitives whose
/// context held still on average. **If it is ~0 the packet approach cannot animate
/// anything** and the whole design is only a different way of doing what the two
/// table smoothers already do. `posed ctx` is the share of contexts showing any of
/// it, which separates "nothing animates" from "one thing animates a lot".
///
/// ## Reading the report
///
/// A person is playing while this runs, so each line labels itself: `yaw` is the
/// mean turn rate and `move` the mean speed over the window, both read from the
/// addresses <see cref="FrameSmoothing"/> uses. A row therefore says on its face
/// whether it was taken standing, walking or turning, and the row that decides
/// this design is the one with a large `yaw`.
///
/// `disp` is the mean distance a matched primitive moved since the last tick. If
/// that is routinely hundreds of pixels the key is matching the wrong things and
/// the match rate is a lie.
