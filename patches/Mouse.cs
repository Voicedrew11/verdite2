/// **The look half is not its own hook.** A mouse is another way of choosing the
/// per-frame turn and pitch step, and <see cref="Analog.BeforeLook"/> already owns
/// that: it pre-loads the velocity word the game is about to accumulate into and
/// asserts the matching button out of the game's own mask table. So this class
/// hands that hook a number and nothing else — one place decides what the camera
/// does in a frame, which is also what keeps a stick and a mouse from writing the
/// same word twice.
///
/// Three things make a mouse different from a stick, and they are the whole
/// design:
///
/// * **A mouse gives displacement, not a rate.** A stick deflection means "turn
///   at this speed for as long as I hold it"; mouse motion means "turn by this
///   much, once". So there is no deadzone, no response curve and no acceleration
///   ramp here — those all shape a held rate — and the pixels go straight to an
///   angle at <see cref="DegreesPerPixel"/> a pixel.
/// * **It has to put the axis down the moment it stops.** The game ramps a
///   released look velocity down over about eleven frames, which on a mouse reads
///   as the camera sliding on after the hand has stopped. That is
///   <see cref="Analog.CameraInstantStop"/>'s job for the stick and an option
///   there; for the mouse it is not optional, so the release runs whatever that
///   setting says.
/// * **The pointer runs out of desktop.** Motion is only motion while the cursor
///   is locked to the window, so the mouse does nothing at all until it is
///   captured — <see cref="CaptureKey"/>, Escape by default, and any popup taking
///   the pointer back.
///
/// The buttons take the other route entirely: <c>PadReadEvent</c> fires inside
/// the BIOS's PAD_dr, so a held mouse button is ORed into the word the game is
/// about to read, as the pad button the player picked. Nothing here knows what
/// "attack" is — the game's own control-config screen decides that, exactly as it
/// does for the pad, and remapping in-game moves the mouse with it. It is also
/// why the buttons work in menus, on the title screen and anywhere else the game
/// reads the pad, without a hook of its own.
