/// <summary>
/// Fog of war for the map: the tiles the player has actually *seen*, remembered
/// per save slot and kept between sessions.
///
/// ## It is the game's own visibility grid, accumulated — and then checked
///
/// **Nothing here is new reverse engineering.** The renderer's first call each
/// frame is func_8002D3A8, which rebuilds a **24×24 byte grid of tile visibility
/// at 0x80192EAC** — the 4:3 frustum flattened onto the map, filled by scanlines
/// and then flooded for occlusion, which is what gates every object and every
/// block of geometry the frame draws. Fog is that grid ORed into an 80×80 bitset.
///
/// ## The grid is a culling test, and a culling test is allowed to over-report
///
/// That grid is **not** "what the player can see": it is "what the frame might
/// have to draw", and the two differ in one direction only. The flood
/// (patches/CullGrid.cs's <c>Cell</c>, a transcription of func_8002CFC8 /
/// func_8002D15C) marches rings out of the eye and lights a cell when
/// **either** of its two parents on the ring inside it is lit. Two parents ORed
/// is a 45° spread per ring, so one lit cell at the mouth of a corridor
/// illuminates an expanding wedge behind the wall beside it — for the renderer
/// that costs a few polygons nobody sees, but for a store that never forgets it
/// paints rooms the player has never been able to see into. That is what
/// "the map reveals places disconnected from the room I am in" is.
///
/// So a lit cell is **verified against the floor plan** before it is written:
/// recursive symmetric shadowcasting (eight octants, the standard Bergström
/// form) out of the player's own tile over the 80×80 map, with a tile opaque
/// when it carries no drawn model (<c>+0 &gt;= 240</c>, the renderer's own test —
/// the gaps between rooms *are* the walls in this game). A tile is revealed only
/// when the game lit it **and** an unobstructed line exists; the two disagreeing
/// is the leak, and the intersection is the fix. Shadowcasting rather than one
/// Bresenham ray per cell because a ray between tile centres cuts the corners
/// off a doorway and would under-reveal, and because it is symmetric: what you
/// can see from a tile is what can see you.
///
/// **Both stacked halves are cast, and a cell is answered by the one its own bit
/// names** — see <see cref="CastFrom"/> for why asking the game which floor the
/// player is on is the wrong question. The cast depends on the player's tile and
/// the map alone, not on where the camera points, so it is taken once per tile
/// step (and re-taken every <see cref="LosPeriodMs"/> ms, since a drawbridge and
/// a minecart are tiles) rather than 60 times a second. A window with no wall in
/// it is an unloaded map rather than an open field, so that half is passed
/// rather than refused: the gate **fails open**, back to the old behaviour, never
/// to a blank map.
///
/// Measured over a walk through all eight areas: **3993 of 8469 lit cells
/// refused** — in area 7 a corridor five tiles the far side of a wall mass, lit
/// by the flood and invisible from where the player stood — the player's own
/// tile revealed on every sample, nothing outside the cast window, and 144.0 fps
/// at 20.0 ticks/s with the minimap open. What no counter can say is whether the
/// revealed shape now matches where the player walked; that is still the one
/// thing to look at.
///
///     KF2_MAP_FOG_LOS=0      the gate off: the raw cull grid, as it was
///
/// The cell/world mapping is the queries' own: `cell = (world &gt;&gt; 11) + Offset`,
/// so the world tile of cell (0,0) is the negated pair at 0x80192EA0/0xA4 —
/// **tile coordinates, stored as words**, which is why a negative origin wraps to
/// a huge unsigned value and is rejected by the same `&lt; 80` bound the game uses
/// rather than indexing backwards.
///
/// ## The sampling clock is the vblank, and that is why there is no hook
///
/// The accumulator has to run **with the map closed**, so it cannot live in a
/// panel's Draw the way every other read in patches/Map.cs does. The obvious seam
/// is a post-hook on func_8002D3A8 — and it is the seam to fall back to — but
/// <c>VSyncEvent</c> costs no hook at all, and since patches/recompone/0021 it
/// fires on a **wall-clock 60 Hz grid** rather than per rendered frame, so the
/// sample rate is 60/s at 20 fps and 60/s at 144 fps. The grid is stable for the
/// whole frame once built, so a vblank read gets a complete one.
///
/// Two consequences, both accepted rather than discovered later:
///
/// * At the 20 fps default each grid is sampled three times. The OR is idempotent,
///   so that costs 576 byte reads and changes nothing.
/// * At 144 fps, 60 of the 144 grids are sampled. A cone 72° wide would need the
///   player to turn faster than 72° in 16 ms to leave a gap, which is faster than
///   the game turns; if play ever shows slivers, the fix is the post-hook above.
///
/// ## The staleness guard, which is the trap
///
/// The area byte at 0x8017E060 moves when the save's area is unpacked, and the
/// grid in RAM is still the last frame the *previous* area rendered — the same
/// window patches/Map.cs's 250 ms re-copy self-corrects through. ORing that into
/// the new area's record would write a permanent lie, since nothing ever clears
/// it. So a sample is taken only when the **camera** (0x80192E78/0x80192E80, world
/// units like the player's own) is within two tiles of the player, and never in
/// the 250 ms after an overlay load. A cutscene camera somewhere else stops the
/// accumulation, which is the conservative way round.
///
/// ## Identity: the game's slot byte, and a scratch bucket for slot 0
///
/// A record is keyed `(slot, area)`. The slot is the game's own record at
/// 0x8006E5D4, which both the load (func_80023638) and the save (func_80023764)
/// write and which is **zero until one of them has run** — so a New Game
/// accumulates into a scratch bucket, and the moment the byte becomes 1..3 the
/// scratch is merged into that slot and dropped. The consequence to know is that
/// the identity is the *slot*, not the save: starting a New Game over slot 2
/// inherits slot 2's old fog.
///
/// ## What has not been looked at
///
/// The mechanism is measured; the picture is the user's to judge. Whether the
/// revealed shape matches where they walked, whether the brightened in-view cone
/// reads or distracts, whether fog belongs on by default, and whether revealing a
/// whole tile — both stacked floor halves at once, since the visibility grid has
/// no notion of the halves — is noticeable on a map that draws one half at a time.
///
///     KF2_MAP_FOG=1          fog on for the run (kf2.map.fog; off by default)
///     KF2_MAP_FOG_PROBE=1    a line a second: revealed, seen, lit, rejected, flushes
