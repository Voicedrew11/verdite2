# Environment variables

Every `KF2_*` switch the port reads, in one list. Most are wired up in
`Program.cs` or read by the patch they belong to (`patches/*.cs`); the document
named for each feature in `NOTES.md` explains what the comparison is for. A
variable marked *no longer a setting* is the only way left to reach that
behaviour — its control came out of the settings window and its saved key is not
read.

Prefer the mods under `mods/` (enable them in the game's Mods panel) to
`KF2_LOG=sdk`, which is gigabytes a minute. `KF2_LOG=bios` is worse during play:
the game polls `PAD_dr` hundreds of thousands of times a second.
