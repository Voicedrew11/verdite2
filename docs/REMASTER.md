# The remaster: authoring tools first, effects second

**A design document, and from Phase 1 on a record of the work done against it.**
Phase 1 is in, in two slices (see "Phase 1, the first slice" and "Phase 1, the
second slice" under the roadmap), with materials since keyed by face ("Faces, picked
from the frame"); Phase 2 has its first slice ("Phase 2, the first slice"), and so
does Phase 3 ("Phase 3, the first slice"); Phase 4 is in, rescoped to materials
by texture ("Phase 4, the second slice"), and metalness made a tinted mirror
("Metal is a tinted mirror"); Phase 5 is in: overrides of the game's own light
records ("Phase 5, the first slice"), after a census showed only the renderer reads
them, the area's darkness, shadows, and the fog's colour and the sky ("Phase 5, the
second slice"); Phase 6 has its first slice, tile edits behind their own switch
("Phase 6, the first slice"); Phase 7 has its first slice, the free camera, the
compatibility report and the export ("Phase 7, the first slice"); Phase 8 has its
first slice, props drawn from the area's own object models ("Phase 8, the first
slice"). The
stretch goal is a full visual remaster the user authors themselves: placing lights,
assigning materials, tuning reflections, editing levels. **An effect is worth
nothing to that goal until it can be placed, tuned, saved and shared**, so this
document plans the authoring tools and the data they write first, and treats each
rendering feature as something those tools drive.

Every claim about the existing port is marked the way the rest of `docs/` marks
them: **Confirmed** (measured, or read from the code), **Inferred** (fits the
evidence, not tested) and **Open** (not known). Every planned feature keeps
"mechanism measured" apart from "picture judged". Features ship **off**, and off
must be bit-identical to the picture the port draws today.

The request this answers arrived with some lines cut off. It was read as asking
for:
- each phase's measurement that proves it works;
- the cost of each feature, on and off;
- the remaster being off by default;
- the seams between the layers;
- versioning, and how a pack layers over the base game and over other packs;
- in-game or external editing;
- driving the game with `KF2_SHELL`, `goto`, a free camera and pause;
- forward or deferred lighting.

If one of those readings is wrong, the section built on it is the one to revisit.

## What this is, and what it is not

**"Full visual remaster" needs a target before it needs a renderer.** Two
remasters could come out of this port. One keeps the game's look and adds light,
material and surface detail to it. The other replaces the art. The tools are the
same for both, but the order of the phases is not, and neither is what "done"
means. **Recommendation:** take one area from start to finish before spreading
across all of them. `fdat02` is the obvious one:
- it is where `KF2_AUTOSTART=new` stands, so the spawn is fixed;
- it has water, so the reflection passes were measured there;
- the SSR and planar readbacks already have numbers for it.

Area 1 with save slot 2 (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`) is the second test scene, as it is
for everything else.

**What this document deliberately does not do:**
- It does not design a new renderer. Everything here extends the passes the port
  already has.
- It does not replace creature meshes.
- It does not add walkable geometry beyond what the tile grid can already express.

Each of those gets a paragraph below saying why.

## What exists, and what each piece gives the remaster

**Most of the machinery a remaster needs is already in the tree, because the
port learned to name its geometry before it had a reason to.** The C# assemblers
know which routine built each packet. The two walks know which tile and which
model. The surface buffer already stores a material per pixel. What is missing
is anything authored, and anything that remembers it.

| piece | what it is | what it gives the remaster |
|---|---|---|
| `Gpu/SurfaceMaterial.cs` (`0067`) | a per-pixel material id stored in the surface buffer's alpha, 8 slots, with a `Reflectivity`/`F0` table the port fills | **The material channel.** The id already reaches the reflection pass, and "What a surface is made of" in `RENDERING.md` names lighting as its next reader. Eight ids is too few to author with, so widening it is an amendment to `0067` |
| `GtePacketDepth` (`0050`) | per-packet corner depths, `Solid` and **`Material`**, written by the C# assemblers | **Where authored per-tile and per-model materials are written.** `SurfaceMaterial.Classify` already prefers the packet's material. **Confirmed**: `PolyAssemblerDepth.SealDepth` is the one place a record is sealed, and it never sets `Material` |
| `GteLightMap` (`0048`) | per-corner lit colour or light dots and the raw depth cue; `BK`/`LCM` by generation | **The chain authored lights join.** `shade8` rebuilds the game's colour per pixel from these inputs; an authored light adds a term to it |
| `GteTexRect` (`0060`) | the texture rectangle of a face, for clipped fans | **A stable rectangle for a texture key**, where a clipped fan's own UVs would give a different rectangle every frame |
| `patches/TileWalk.cs` | the 24×24 cell sweep, a cell's two halves, one half set up and assembled | **Tiles, by coordinate, as they are drawn.** It knows `(x, z, half)`, the world position and the assembler. It does not *publish* the current tile yet, the way `ModelWalk.SetSubmit` publishes the current model |
| `ModelWalk.Scene` | a `ModelDraw` per submit: kind, slot, record, model id, world position, assembler, light record | **Models and instances, by table and slot, with a world position.** Used for picking, per-model materials and light receivers. `SubmitKind`/`SubmitRecord`/`SubmitSlot` are live while a packet is being built |
| `patches/PlanarWalk.cs` (`0068`) | the tile walk run again, and the model submits replayed, from a camera mirrored in the water, with every piece of state saved and restored | **Proof that the scene can be drawn from a second camera without disturbing the first.** It is the template for the editor's free camera, and for any later pass drawn from a light's point of view |
| `patches/AoWorld.cs` (`0059`) | the area's 80×80 tile grid as a GPU texture, and the camera's rotation and world position as uniforms | **World space inside a shader.** It turns a fragment's view position into a world one, and it is a grid a shader can march, which gives coarse shadows for authored lights |
| `patches/Map*.cs` | the full-screen plan, the docked panel with a readout of all ten tile bytes under the cursor, fog of war, markers | **The editor's top-down view and tile picker, mostly written.** It also holds the one invariant that proves the tile addressing: the player stands on a drawn half with a floor-height gap of 0 |
| upstream `Assets/` | texture and XA replacement packs: `pack.json`, content-hashed texture keys, `TextureDumper`, a Texture Inspector panel | **Texture identity and replacement images, already built.** See below |
| `FrameCapture` (`0046`) | one run of stage 13, scrubbed GP0 command by command, with an owner routine for each command | **Picking a texture on demand**: which command drew this pixel, and so which texture page, CLUT and UVs |
| `OutputView` (`0029`) | where the game picture sits in the window, in window pixels and in game pixels | **Where the editor draws its gizmos** |
| `KF2_SHELL` and `mcp/` | `goto`, `state`, `nearby`, `load`, `warp`, `press` over TCP | **How an agent drives every measurement below without seeing the window** |
| `scripts/shader_probe.c`, `scripts/light_probe.c` | the real fragment shaders run headless over known inputs, read back | **The bit-identical proof for a shader branch that is switched off** |

### Upstream already has a texture pack system, and the port's docs never mention it

**Confirmed, read from the vendored tree.** `tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Runtime/Assets/`
holds:
- `AssetReplacerManager`, which loads `./packs/` as folders or zips at startup;
- `AssetPack` and `PackManifest`: `pack.json` with `id`, `name`, `author`,
  `version`, `priority`, a `game` id (strict by default), and lists of textures,
  CLUTs, texture rules and XA replacements;
- `TextureTile.Hash`: an FNV-64 hash of the texel indices plus a separate hash
  of only the CLUT entries those indices use;
- `TextureResolver`, `TextureDumper` and `TextureRegistry`;
- a Texture Inspector panel with tile and page dumping.

`GlCore.ResolveReplacement` binds the replacement as `uRepTex`/`uRepClut` in
`PrimFs`.

That is the right identity for a texture and the right home for replacement
images, and the remaster should use it rather than build a second one. **What has
not been measured is how it behaves on the port's own texture path.** That path
has three pieces:
- the anisotropic kernel (`0041`) in `decode()`;
- the texture-rectangle clamp and the mip atlas (`0060`);
- the fluid scroll (`0053`).

The replacement branch in `PrimFs` sits beside all three. **Inferred**: a
replaced texture skips the mip atlas and the rectangle clamp. That is the first
thing Phase 4 measures. **Answered by reading `PrimFs`** (see "Phase 4, the first
slice"): a replaced texture (`texMode` 6) was one bilinear `texture()` with no
mips and no anisotropy; a replaced CLUT skipped both the anisotropic taps and the
mip atlas. The rectangle clamp holds by construction, since the replacement is its
own texture clamped at its edge. Neither goes through `0053`'s scroll.

## Identity: what authored data attaches to

**Everything else in this document depends on this section, so it comes first.**
Authored data has to stay attached to the same thing across frames, sessions,
save files, the port's own settings, and differently mastered discs. Packet
addresses change every frame. LBAs change between masterings. Screen positions
change with the render scale and the aspect.

### The rule for what an authored file may hold

**Identifiers the game defines, and the author's own values. Never the game's
payload.** Allowed:
- area numbers, tile coordinates, table indices and model ids;
- content hashes;
- colours, positions, intensities and file names the author chose.

Never allowed: bytes, texels, vertices, text or any other copy of disc content.
A hash is a fingerprint, not a copy: it cannot be turned back into the texture
or the tile block it was taken from. This rule is what lets a pack sit in the
repository and be shared between players who each own the disc.

### The keys, and what breaks each one

| key | names | what breaks it | how the design survives it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Game**: the disc serial `SLUS-00158`, as upstream's strict `PackGame.Id` | the whole pack | a different game, above all the US-boxed *King's Field II* (`SLUS-00255`) | already refused twice: by `DiscCheck.Validate` and by a strict pack game id |
| **Area**: the area byte at `0x8017E060` **plus an area fingerprint**, an FNV-64 of the 64,000-byte tile block **less each half's `+2`** and the first `0x600` bytes of the collision-shape block, **taken from the loader's source buffer** as `func_80017244` copies each into `0x801C8484` and `0x801D8484` — the disc's bytes, before the game rewrites any. `+2` is out because the game writes a moving footprint into it (**Confirmed**, see "Phase 1, the first slice"); the live block is out because doors and lifts rewrite `+3` and `+4` and a save keeps them (**Confirmed**, see "The fingerprint moved with the game's progress") | everything authored in that area | a different revision or region of the same game | the fingerprint is taken before the remaster's own edits and before the game's. **On a mismatch the area's layers are switched off whole, and the editor says why**; they are never half-applied |
| **Tile half**: `(area, x, z, lower \| upper)` | the mesh instance the tile draws, whole (a cave tile's floor, ceiling and rock together; see "A tile half is a whole mesh"); a face of it is `(tile half, mesh, face index)`; its collision cell; its light record (`+4 & 0x3F`) | the game rewriting tiles at run time: the drawbridge and the minecart are tiles, not models (see "The map is an 80x80 tile grid" in `GAME_INTERNALS.md`) | the key stays valid, but what it names can change under it. An entry may carry a condition on the tile's current model index, which is an index and not payload |
| **Tile mesh**: `(area, model index at half +0)` | every instance of that mesh in the area | nothing known. **Open**: where the area's model bank lives, and so whether two areas share a mesh | once the bank is found, a content hash of the mesh gives an identity across areas |
| **Model**: `ModelDraw.Model` (the model id), and for objects `(area, definition index at rec +0x6)` | "every creature of this kind", "every torch" | an MO morph changes a model's vertices, not its identity | a kind is the natural key for materials and for lights attached to a model |
| **Instance**: `(area, table, spawn ordinal)`, where the ordinal is the slot the area loader filled | one placed prop or creature | dynamic slots (drops, projectiles, respawns); saved state (a killed creature, a picked-up item) | **Inferred**, not measured, that static props land in the same slot on every load. Fallback: `(area, definition index, spawn position rounded to 64 units)`, matched to the nearest live record at load |
| **Texture**: upstream's `(index hash, CLUT hash, bpp, w, h)` | a piece of art, wherever VRAM puts it | (a) the key hashes the **polygon's UV bounds**, so one piece of art can have several keys; (b) the scrolling textures are re-uploaded every tick, so their content, and their hash, changes every tick; (c) a CLUT that cycles; (d) a region the GPU drew into is rejected as dirty; (e) a port patch that changes a palette (`MessageText` zeroes one) | (a) key a face on its `GteTexRect` rectangle, and measure whether the game uploads per texture or per page (**Open**); (b) key a fluid slot's face on the slot's source image in RAM, which does not scroll (see "Phase 4, the second slice"); (c, e) a material keys on the **index hash alone**, with the CLUT hash as an optional narrowing |
| **Face**: `(mesh key, primitive index)` | one polygon of one mesh | nothing, provided the assembler can expose the index | only needed for per-face materials, late in the roadmap |

### What the keys survive by construction

- **Render scale and widescreen.** Every key is in world space or VRAM space, and
  VRAM is always the console's 1× (`0054`). Nothing is keyed on a screen position.
- **A mod or patch being toggled.** The area fingerprint is taken before edits.
  Materials key on the texel indices, not the palette, so a patch that zeroes a
  palette leaves the key alone. `kf2debug`'s noclip moves the player, not the map.
- **A different mastering.** No LBA, file offset or `fdat` sector appears in any
  key. The generated dispatch tables bake LBAs (see `PACKAGING.md`); the remaster
  must never read them.
- **A save file.** Tile, model, texture and area keys are all re-resolved when an
  area settles. Instance keys are the weak ones, and their edits are the ones that
  can leak into a save (see "Level editing").

**Forbidden as keys:** a packet address, an ordering-table position, a screen
position, a VRAM position on its own, an LBA, and a slot number for anything that
can be spawned.

### When an area has settled

**Confirmed in Phase 1, with two additions the design did not have.** A New Game
passed the floor test once *before* `fdat02` loaded, on the block the last area
left, so an area can settle only after an `fdat` module has loaded since the last
executable did. And the fingerprint must read the same twice 200 ms apart, so a
block still being copied in cannot settle.

**The loader is not the signal.** `func_8001689C` is called every frame with the
load inside a branch (see "The area loader looks like the right hook and is not"
in `PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`), and `OverlayLoadedEvent` fires before the tile block
is copied. The map patches wait for the invariant instead: the player stands on a
drawn half whose floor height matches their own Y exactly. The identity layer
uses the same test, plus the area byte changing. It settles on the first frame
both hold, and only then applies the area's layers. The fingerprint it settles on
is the one hashed as the loader copied the block in; only if that copy was never
seen does it fall back to the live block, and the probe line says `LIVE` when it
does.

### What has to be measured before the keys are trusted

1. **Instance stability.** Load an area twice, reload a save, and compare
   `slot → (definition index, position)` for the object and creature tables.
2. **The model bank's address**, for mesh identity across areas.
3. **Texture upload granularity.** Do `LoadImage` calls carry one texture each,
   or whole pages? That decides whether key (a) needs normalising. **Measured**
   (see "Phase 4, the first slice" and "the second slice"): one texture each --
   the map's as 128x128 images (`32x128` words at 4 bpp), sometimes in two
   pieces, the models' as 64x64, 32x32 and 16x16 -- and the scrolling textures in
   strips every tick. Keys are normalised to the upload, pieces joined, and a
   scrolling texture is keyed on its source image.
4. **Which tile bytes the game rewrites at run time, and when.** **Measured** by the
   rewrite census (see "Phase 6, the first slice"): in area 1, 100 upper halves, in
   `+0`, `+3` and `+4`, all of them within seconds of the settle.

## Architecture: five layers and the seams between them

**A new feature must be a new file, not an edit to five.** The port's patches have
so far each been a vertical slice: hooks, state, settings page, probe, shader.
That works for one feature and does not work for twenty, because each one edits
`GlCore`, `GlShaders`, `Program.cs` and a settings page. The remaster splits the
work into layers, and each layer has one owner.

```
  editor UI (patches/editor/)     picks, gizmos, inspectors, undo
        |  edits documents only
  data model (patches/remaster/)  packs, documents, layering, versions, file watch
        |  change events, on the game thread
  application (one IRemasterFeature per layer)
        |  writes side tables and uniforms, hooks through HookAttach
  render features (vendored runtime, 0071+)   one uniform block, shader terms
        |
  identity (patches/remaster/Identity.cs)     area, fingerprint, keys, resolvers
```

1. **Identity** (`patches/remaster/Identity.cs`). This layer:
   - detects when an area has settled and takes the fingerprint;
   - defines the key types;
   - resolves a world position to a tile half, a `ModelDraw` to an instance or a
     model, and a texture to its key through upstream's `TextureTile`.

   It reads guest memory and writes nothing.
2. **Data model** (`patches/remaster/Pack*.cs`). This layer:
   - reads and writes documents as JSON;
   - migrates versions and layers packs;
   - watches the pack directory. A change on disk is parsed on a worker thread
     and swapped in at the next `VSyncEvent`, the same marshal point `KF2_SHELL`
     uses for its light commands.
3. **Application**. One `IRemasterFeature` per layer:

   ```csharp
   interface IRemasterFeature
   {
       string Id { get; }                       // "lights", "surfaces", "level", ...
       bool Enabled { get; set; }               // KF2_REMASTER_<ID>, and a setting
       void Attach();                           // through HookAttach; read back IsCommitted
       void Detach();                           // puts back everything it changed
       void OnAreaSettled(AreaContext area);    // resolve keys, apply edits
       void OnDocumentChanged(DocumentChange c);
       void OnTick();  void OnFrame();
       void DrawInspector(Selection s);         // the editor's panel for this layer
       string Probe();                          // the KF2_REMASTER_PROBE line
   }
   ```

   The features are registered in one list in `patches/remaster/Remaster.cs`,
   which `Program.cs` installs **before `LoopPacing`**. `LoopPacing` has to stay
   last, because its post on stage 13 must run after the smoothers'. `Detach` is
   what makes off bit-identical: a feature that cannot put something back does not
   change it.
4. **Render features** (the vendored runtime). One new runtime file owns a single
   `RemasterUniforms` block: the material table, the light list, the fog colour
   and the sky. `GlCore` uploads it by generation, and the shaders read it. Once
   that block exists, a later render feature adds fields to it and a term to a
   shader, without editing `GlCore` again. Numbering follows the rule in
   `RECOMPONE_PATCHES.md`, where a new number is for a new mechanism:
   - widening the material ids and moving their table into the block **amends
     `0067`**;
   - authored lights are `0071`;
   - replacement textures on the port's path are `0073` (see "Phase 4, the first
     slice");
   - fog colour and the sky fill are `0074`;
   - normal and roughness maps are `0075`;
   - a GPU id buffer for picking would be `0076`, and only if it turns out to be
     needed;
   - shadows for the authored lights are `0077` (see "Shadows, the first slice"),
     numbered past the three held above.

   `snap`'s readback of the presented picture took `0069` and the hook order
   `0070`, so each planned number moved along from what this plan first said.
   `0071` is in (see "Phase 2, the first slice"); the block holds the light list
   only. **The material table did not move into it**: it stays `SurfaceMaterial`'s,
   widened by the `0067` amendment and uploaded as a 256×2 texture that the prim and
   reflection shaders both read, because 256 ids of reflectivity, F0, roughness and
   an emissive colour as uniform arrays would pass the fragment stage's uniform
   minimum (see "Phase 3, the first slice").

   All of it is **GL core only**; the 2.1 path and the software rasterizer ignore
   it, as they do `0048` and `0067`.
5. **Editor UI** (`patches/editor/`). ImGui panels, with gizmos drawn over
   `OutputView`. It reads the data model, the identity resolvers and the scene
   the walks publish. **It writes only documents**, never a side table or a
   uniform. That keeps undo, saving and live reload the same operation.

**The seam that matters most is between the editor and the application.** An
edit is a document change. The feature hears about it on the game thread and
re-applies. Nothing in the editor can put the game into a state the saved file
cannot reproduce.

## Data model and file format

### A remaster pack is an upstream asset pack with a `remaster/` directory

**Recommendation: do not invent a second pack format.** A remaster pack is a
folder or zip under `packs/`, with upstream's `pack.json` at its root. That gives
it for free:
- a game-id check;
- a priority order;
- enable and disable;
- loading from a zip;
- replacement textures and XA.

The port's own data sits next to `pack.json`, in `remaster/`, as one JSON file
**per layer per area**, so that a diff is small and two people editing different
areas never touch the same file:

```
packs/verdite-stone/
  pack.json                        upstream's manifest: id, name, author, version, game, priority
  textures/...                     upstream replacement images (the author's own art)
  remaster/
    pack.remaster.json             formatVersion, the features the pack uses, a gameplay-changing flag
    materials.json                 the material library, referred to by name
    textures.json                  per-texture: material, normal/roughness map, emissive
    areas/1/lights.json
    areas/1/surfaces.json          tile, mesh and model -> material
    areas/1/atmosphere.json        fog colour and curve, sky, light-record overrides
    areas/1/level.json             tile byte edits
    areas/1/props.json             props: the area's object models, placed
```

Every area file carries its gate:

```json
{ "formatVersion": 1, "area": 1, "fingerprint": "9f3c1a0be4d27765" }
```

### The documents, by example

A material is named, and packs refer to it by name, so ids are allocated at load
time and two packs cannot collide on a number:

```json
// materials.json
{ "formatVersion": 1,
  "materials": {
    "polished-stone": { "reflectivity": 0.35, "f0": 0.04, "roughness": 0.3 },
    "wet-rock":       { "reflectivity": 0.2,  "f0": 0.03, "roughness": 0.6 },
    "brazier-coal":   { "emissive": [1.0, 0.45, 0.1], "emissiveStrength": 0.8,
                        "light": 1.0, "lightColour": [1.0, 0.6, 0.3] } } }
```

Surfaces assign materials, and the most specific key wins: a face of a half, the
whole half, a face of a mesh anywhere in the area, the whole mesh. A face list names
the mesh it was authored on and that mesh's hash, and applies only while both still
hold (see "Faces, picked from the frame"). A model is named by the table it comes
out of and its model id, since a creature and an object may share an id and not a
mesh:

```json
// areas/1/surfaces.json
{ "formatVersion": 1, "area": 1, "fingerprint": "9f3c1a0be4d27765",
  "tiles":  [ { "x": 35, "z": 36, "half": "upper", "material": "polished-stone" },
              { "x": 36, "z": 36, "half": "upper",
                "mesh": 1, "meshHash": "8613becbcde29491", "faces": { "1": "mirror" } } ],
  "meshes": [ { "mesh": 12, "meshHash": "0c41d9e2a7b3f865", "material": "wet-rock",
                "faces": { "3": "polished-stone" } } ],
  "models": [ { "kind": "object", "model": 486, "material": "brazier-coal" } ] }
```

Lights are world positions in the game's own units: a tile is 2048, a height step
is 128, and up is **−Y**. Built so far: `type`, `position`, `colour`, `intensity`,
`radius`, `direction`, `cone`, `flicker` and `enabled`; `falloff` is always the
smooth window, and `affects` and `shadow` are kept on a round trip and read by
nothing:

```json
// areas/1/lights.json
{ "formatVersion": 1, "area": 1, "fingerprint": "9f3c1a0be4d27765",
  "lights": [
    { "name": "hall brazier", "type": "point",
      "position": [72704, -15360, 73728], "colour": [1.0, 0.62, 0.3],
      "intensity": 1.2, "radius": 4096, "falloff": "smooth",
      "affects": "both", "shadow": "none",
      "flicker": { "amount": 0.15, "hz": 7 } },
    { "name": "shaft", "type": "spot", "position": [70000, -18000, 70000],
      "direction": [0, 1, 0], "cone": [20, 35], "colour": [0.7, 0.8, 1.0],
      "intensity": 0.6, "radius": 6144 } ] }
```

Textures use upstream's key string for the art, so a key read off
`TextureDumper` or the Inspector can be pasted in as it is:

```json
// textures.json

Atmosphere and level edits are covered in their own sections below.

### Versions, layers and removal

- **A version per file.** `formatVersion` is an integer, bumped when a field
  changes meaning. `PackMigrations.cs` holds one function per step. **Unknown
  fields are kept on a round trip**, so a newer pack opened in an older editor
  loses nothing. The editor always writes the current version.
- **Layering.** From bottom to top:
  1. the base game (no packs);
  2. packs, in upstream's priority order;
  3. the user's working pack, always on top.

  Each layer overrides the ones below it **per key**, not per file. An explicit
  `null` for a key removes it, which is how one pack turns off a light another
  pack placed.

  **Built** (`patches/remaster/Pack.Layers.cs`). A layer is any pack under
  `packs/` -- folder or zip, upstream's `pack.json`, its game id checked -- with a
  `remaster/` directory, read by the port itself rather than from upstream's list,
  which is filled when the CD comes up and keeps no enable state. Lowest priority is
  lowest; the working pack is always on top and never listed as a layer. The keys:
  a material by name; a tile half or a level edit by `x`, `z` and `half`; a mesh by
  its index; a model rule by `kind` and `model`; a light or a prop by `name`; a
  record override by `record`; a texture rule by `index` and `clut`. A removal is an
  entry of those key fields with `"removed": true`, and for a material the name
  mapped to `null`. **Every edit works as it did**, because the documents the
  features and the editor read are the merge: `Save` writes only what differs from
  the layers below (a changed entry whole, a new one, and a removal for every key the
  author took away), so the working pack holds the author's changes and nothing
  inherited. A removal is kept while nothing below holds its key, so switching a
  layer off and on again does not lose it; putting an entry of that key back
  replaces it. Each layer has a switch on the Remaster packs page (and `pack layer
  ID on|off`), saved per pack id and on by default, since a pack in `packs/` was put
  there to be used and nothing applies until the remaster is on; switching one keeps
  the working pack's unsaved edits, but not their undo.
- **The fingerprint gate applies per pack.** A pack whose area fingerprint does
  not match is off for that area only, and the Remaster packs page lists it with
  the reason. **Built** as: where two layers both hold a document for an area and
  kind, and their fingerprints differ, the upper one stands alone and the lower is
  set aside for that area and kind, named on the page (and in `pack layers`). The
  merged document then carries the upper fingerprint, which the features gate on as
  before.

  **Measured** with three packs over area 1 (slot 2): a folder pack at priority 10
  holding a torch light, two props and two materials; a zip at priority 5 holding
  area 1's lights against another fingerprint; the working pack holding one of the
  props. `pack layers` listed the zip's area-1 lights as set aside under the folder
  pack's fingerprint; the effective area held the folder pack's torch, its second
  prop, and the working pack's version of the prop both named. Changing the
  inherited torch's intensity, removing the inherited prop and adding a material
  then saving wrote `lights.json` with the torch alone, `props.json` with the
  working prop and `{"name": "pillar", "removed": true}`, and `materials.json` with
  the new material alone; `pack reload` gave back the same effective set. Switching
  the folder pack off and on (`pack layer base off|on`) with an unsaved light kept
  the light and the removal; re-adding a prop of the removed name took its place.
- **Sharing is a zip of the working pack.** By the rule in "Identity" it contains
  no disc data, so it can be committed to this repository and handed to another
  player. Replacement images are the author's own art.

### Settings

- One **Remaster packs** page lists the packs found, whether each is enabled,
  which features each uses, and every load or fingerprint error.
- Each render feature gets one switch under Video ▸ Enhancements, beside the
  existing ones.
- Nothing is enabled on a first run, and the repository ships no pack switched on.
- A pack that changes collision or placement says so on that page, in plain
  words; see "Level editing".

## The editor

**Recommendation: in the game, in ImGui, not an external tool.** The scene exists
only in the running process:
- which tile the cursor is over;
- which model is where this tick;
- which texture a pixel came from;
- the camera block.

A tool outside the process would need all of that sent over a socket every frame,
and could still never show the result as the renderer draws it. In the game,
live reload comes free, and so do `PanelManager`, the map panels, the frame
viewer and `OutputView`.

**External tools keep the jobs they are good at.** The JSON is meant to be edited
by hand and is watched, so a text editor is a first-class tool. Images are drawn
in an image editor. A mesh importer for port-drawn props, if one is ever built,
is a command-line converter.

### Modes

- **Play.** The editor is closed and costs one bool a frame.
- **Edit.** The world is paused through `FramePacing.PauseWhen`, the mechanism the
  full-screen map already uses. Stage gating holds and the renderer keeps
  drawing, so lights and materials update live on a frozen scene. The editor
  camera takes over, and the panels open.

  **Shift+E** is proposed as the hotkey. It has to be checked against
  `KeyLayout` and the existing Shift+P, Shift+F and Shift+M, M and N.

  The panel opens docked at the right edge of the picture. On an opening where
  ImGui has not already put it in a dock node, it splits the Output panel's node
  (`OutputView.DockId`, `0029`) and takes the right side, about 440 base-font
  pixels wide; a docked panel closed keeps its node, hidden, and reopens there, so
  wherever the user moves it after, it stays. `edit` reports `docked` and the
  panel's rectangle. Measured with no saved layout: first open docked at
  x 1347-2226 of a 2226-wide viewport, and at the same place after closing and
  reopening.

  Opening it releases the pointer from mouse look, and closing it captures the
  pointer again if opening took it -- `MenuMouse`'s shape, in the panel's `IsOpen`
  setter, so Shift+E, the close button and `edit` all go through it. **Closing it
  with Shift+E always captures the pointer** (with mouse look on), even if it was
  free when the editor opened: that key is how a player goes back to playing. The
  close button and `edit off` keep the rule above, so a click on the panel or an
  agent's session does not grab the pointer.

### The panel's layout

The panel is laid out for a narrow dock beside the picture: a header that never
scrolls, then six tabs, each with a body that scrolls on its own
(`InputSection.Tab`'s shape). Nothing is a separate section below the rest.

- **The header** (`Editor.Header.cs`) has four parts:
  - The remaster's switch, Save, Undo and Redo (each button's tooltip names what it
    would undo), and "unsaved" or the time of the last save.
  - The area and the selection in a few words, with the fingerprint on hover.
  - Three toggles: the selection's tint, the player's tile, and the free camera,
    whose speed and "back to the player" appear as one row under it while it is
    on.
  - What stops the pack applying: one warning inline, several as a count with the
    list on hover. A failed pick's reason stays here until the next pick.
- **The tabs** are an icon (Font Awesome solid, which `FontSet` already merges)
  and a word. The bar shrinks the words when the panel is narrow.
  - **Material:** the selection card (what is picked, *Select more*, *Assign to*,
    the material that rule names, and the *Result*), then *Edit material*: one
    library entry at a time, which moves to the selection's material whenever that
    changes, so pick, assign and tweak happen on one tab. See "The Material tab".
  - **Lights:** add at the eye or Place, the list, the selected light's fields.
  - **Atmos:** one light record, followed or chosen, over two groups, *Light* and
    *Fog*, each with the whole area's settings above the record's. See "The
    Atmosphere tab".
  - **Level:** the selected half's tile fields, behind *Apply level edits*.
  - **Props:** add here or Place, the list, the selected prop's fields.
  - **Pack:** the working pack's path, save, reload and export, the packs layered
    under it (a checkbox each), and the compatibility report as one tree node per
    area.
- **Fields are a two-column grid** (`Editor.Layout.cs`): the label takes a fixed
  share of the width and the control fills the rest. A narrow panel shortens the
  controls rather than cutting off labels.
- **An override shows the game's value until it is edited.** In Atmos and Level, a
  field the pack does not override shows the game's value under a plain label.
  Editing it writes the override: the label turns the accent colour with a dot after
  it, and the row gets a button at its end that puts the game's value back. That
  replaced a leading checkbox per field in Atmos and a "game's" button in Level.
  Until 2026-09-28 it was the other way round, the game's values dimmed, which read
  as disabled (a dimmed label means that everywhere else in ImGui) and needed a line
  at the top of the tab to explain itself; a dimmed label now means only that the
  control does nothing at the moment.
- **A slider's grab is see-through in the editor**, so the value centred over it
  stays readable: at 1.00 of a 0.25-4 logarithmic slider the grab sat on the number.
- **A click on the picture does what the open tab is for.**
  - On every tab it picks the faces under it, or the model.
  - On Lights it first grabs a light's arrow or dot. The light gizmos are drawn
    only while that tab is open.
  - A Place button (Lights, Props) arms the next click instead. The armed state
    shows as a hint by the pointer, Esc disarms it, and switching tabs drops it.

  The *Pick on the picture* and *Place on the picture* checkboxes this replaced
  are gone.
- **Ctrl+Z undoes, and Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes. Ctrl+S saves.** They work
  while the panel is open, and not while typing, looking with the free camera, or
  holding a control or a light. That last condition matters because such an edit
  is still a preview and not yet an undo entry.
- **`edit tab NAME` opens a tab from the shell, and `edit` reports the one that
  is open.** The gizmos are ImGui drawing over the picture, not part of the
  presented frame, so `snap` cannot see them. Whether they show on the right tab
  has to be checked by eye.

### The Material tab

Reworked 2026-09-28, because the tab mixed two jobs that looked alike: choosing
which material the selection uses, and editing a material in the library. The
screenshot that prompted it read `Material: (none)` over sliders editing `stone`.
None of it changes what a pack means; the one new field is `lightColour`.

- **One *Assign to* list for every rule**, most specific first, as they win: these
  faces (or this half, or this model), the same faces or the whole mesh on every use
  of it in the area, and the picked art in every area (with *Any palette* under it).
  The texture rule was a collapsing header of its own. It is dropped on every new
  pick, since it reaches every area. *Material* names what that one rule says, and
  *Result* what the selection draws with and which rule gave it
  (`Editor.Effective`, `Surfaces`' order read off the pack, gates ignored).
- **The editor says what it is editing.** *Edit material* shows what names the
  entry across the pack (`Pack.UsesOf`: faces, halves, meshes, models, textures) and
  says so when the selection has no material, has several, or draws with another
  one (with a button to edit that). The id moved to the combo's tooltip. The editor
  follows the selection's *effective* material now, not the one at the chosen scope.
- **Grouped by what is seen.** *Finish*: Roughness, Metal. *Reflection*: Edge
  reflection (`reflectivity`) and F0, greyed out with a *Turn on world reflections*
  button (the retained scene, saved as the setting is) while no reflection is on.
  *Shading*: Shine from lights (`specular`), Ambient occlusion. *Glow (the surface
  itself)*: Colour, Brightness, a Blend radio (*Add over texture* / *Brighten
  texture*, which was the *Light source* checkbox), Fades in fog. *Gives off light*:
  Strength, Reach in tiles, and its colour, the glow's or its own
  (`"lightColour"`; `set material:NAME lightColour R G B|glow`). *Pulse* shows only
  while the material glows or gives light.
- **The grow buttons are *Select more*** and *Whole mesh* is gone from the panel:
  it selected every face of the mesh one by one, which *Whole half* already covers.
  The shell's `select grow mesh` keeps it.

Measured: `lightColour` reaches the glow's light (`light` reports `[1,0,0]` for a
red light on a white glow, and white again after `lightColour glow`), with no
exception over a session of the tab open. The layout itself is for the eye.

### The Atmosphere tab

Reworked 2026-09-28, from a critique of the tab as it was: it was laid out like the
record's bytes rather than the way a room is lit. Nothing a pack means changed.

- **The record comes first**, then two groups. The combo keeps the halves count
  and *edited* while following. *On the picture* has two checkboxes: *Halves* tints
  the frame's triangles whose half names the record (`Faces.Last`, the half's
  `+4 & 0x3F`), and *Light directions* draws the record's three lights as arrows
  from a point 1,800 units ahead of the eye, each in its light's colour (grey when
  dark) and numbered, over a level ring so the elevation reads. Then *Copy to...*,
  *Reset record*, and the count of the record's own overridden fields; the area's
  written and refused counts, which the old footer showed as if they were the
  record's, are its tooltip.
- **Light**: the area's *Darkness*, then the record's back colour and three lights.
  **Fog**: the area's colour, curve, most and sky, then the record's start and
  shape. The two scopes are separated by a heading in each group ("Whole area",
  "Record N"). Fog's start and shape had been in a different section from its colour.
- **A light is a colour, a direction and a strength.** The direction was three
  floats whose length was also the light's strength, so no drag changed one without
  the other. It is a compass bearing (0 faces +Z, 90 faces +X) and an elevation (90
  from straight above), and the strength is the vector's length, 0-2; each has its
  own reset, which keeps the other. A vector that comes back to the game's
  removes the override.
- **One scale for every colour.** The back colour is bytes (`BK = b * 16`, so 256
  is full light) and a light's colour 4.12, so the light's is shown times 256: the
  game's 0.575 reads 147 beside a back colour of 120.
- **The fog's start is in tiles** (2048 view units). *Shape* is one combo, *Knee*,
  *Linear* or *None*, where it was two checkboxes, and start and shape reset
  separately. The old *Linear* ticked over *No fog* wrote a linear fog starting at
  16000, past the slider's end; a start is held to 15999 now.
- **Copy to...** puts the record's overrides on the records ticked, as one undo
  entry (`Pack.CopyRecord`): each part set on the source replaces the target's (per
  light, per field), the target keeps the rest, and a new override takes the target's
  own hash. Shell: `atmos copy N M[,M...]|used`.

Measured (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1, a scratch pack, the tab open): with record 16's
fog at 6000 and record 15's back colour and light 2 colour overridden, `atmos copy 15
16,23` gave record 16 back `200 60 40` and light 2 `1.2 0.7 0.4`, kept its fog 6000
and its own hash `8aed2ed9dca6ad04`; one `pack undo` left only the fog. No exception
with the tab and its overlay drawn.

**Not judged.** The layout, and whether the direction arrows point where the light
visibly comes from. The bearing takes the record's light vector as a world
direction with up at -Y; that holds for floors whatever the tile's turn, but stage 10
turns each matrix through quarter-turns for the tile and model walks, so on a turned
mesh the horizontal part may read rotated.

### Picking

- **Tiles:** the faces under the cursor, from the frame's own triangles. While the
  editor is open every sealed packet is recorded with its face key, its screen
  corners and its depths, and a click takes the nearest, with every other face
  within the coplanar tolerance of it. That is what the depth buffer drew, walls
  and ceilings included. It replaced a ray through the 80×80 grid, which could see
  only floors (see "Faces, picked from the frame").
- **Models:** the same triangles. A model's are recorded with the kind and model
  id the object walk was submitting, so a click whose nearest triangle is a model's
  selects that model (`model:1:object:486`) rather than refusing. Instances are not
  told apart: a material on a model is on every draw of it in the area.
- **Textures:** on a click, a one-frame `FrameCapture`, which already answers
  which GP0 command and owner routine drew a pixel. The command gives the page,
  the CLUT and the UVs, and from those upstream's key. It is only needed on a
  click, so its cost does not matter.
- **The map panel** doubles as a top-down tile picker: it already reads all ten
  bytes under the cursor.
- **No GPU id buffer at first.** It would be a render-target attachment and a
  per-triangle id, which is a new runtime mechanism (`0076`). The CPU paths
  answer everything the first phases need.

### Gizmos

Gizmos are a move handle on each of the three axes, a radius sphere and a
direction arrow for a spot light. They are drawn in the ImGui draw list over
`OutputView`'s rectangle and projected the same way the AO and SSR passes
reconstruct positions: the view matrix at `0x80192E18`, H, and OFX/OFY. Snapping
is to 128 units in Y, the height step, and to tile centres in X and Z.

### The editor camera

**`Stage13.ViewOverride`.** Stage 13 is C# (`patches/Stage13.cs`), so the view
a frame is drawn from is a value: set a `Camera` and every frame is drawn from it,
with no camera block to save and put back. See "Drawing the frame from another
camera" in `docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`.

**The visibility grid follows, measured.** The 24×24 window is built by the game's
own `func_8002D3A8`, which reads its eye from the camera block and nothing else of
the player's. So the grid is right for a free eye by construction. The `view` shell
verb tests it: the grid built from an override camera is byte-identical to the grid
built with the player standing there, with the player 3 to 20 tiles away in six
directions. (`patches/CullGrid.cs` was not the route: it is off by default and does
not match the game's build.)

**The arm and the object walk read the player's position, and it does not matter**:
the arm only for its tile's light record (and the free camera leaves it out), the walk
only to range an ambient sound. A frame drawn from the free camera hashed the same with
the player far away and standing under it; see "Phase 7, the first slice".

**A second view drawn beside the game's**, such as a picture-in-picture preview or
a shadow map's light view, is a `ScenePass` around `Stage13.DrawScene(c, mem,
camera)`: the pass points the frame at a table and arena of its own and puts back
everything any pass moves. See "A pass of the port's own" in
`docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`.

### Undo, save, autosave

- **Undo** is a stack of document diffs, each able to apply and revert, kept per
  session. An edit made through a gizmo drag is one entry, not one per frame.
- **Save** is explicit, and writes the working pack's files.
- **Autosave** writes a `.autosave` file next to each changed document every 30
  seconds. On startup, the editor offers to restore it.

### Driving it without a window

New `KF2_SHELL` verbs, also exposed through `mcp/`, so an agent can run every
measurement in the roadmap:

```
edit on|off|tab NAME               enter or leave Edit mode (pause, editor camera); open a tab
select <key>                       select by key: tile:1:35:36:upper, model:41, tex:5b1e..., light:1:"hall brazier"
set <key> <field> <value>          change one field through the same undo stack the panels use
pack save|reload|list              the working pack
pack report|export [PATH]          the compatibility report per area; the saved pack as a zip
camera on|off|move|turn|at         the editor's free camera
snap [hash|PATH] [after N] [buffer Y|any]   the presented picture: its hash, what changed, a PNG
```

**`snap` is the tool the whole "off is bit-identical" rule depends on.** It is
built from what "Getting pixels out without a screenshot" in `DEVELOPMENT.md`
already does: the presented target read back from a `DrawOTag` post and written
with `PngWriter`. With the world paused and the view pinned by `goto x y z yaw
pitch`, two runs give comparable frames.

## Lighting: authored lights beside the game's own

**The game's lighting is a known chain, and the port already rebuilds it per
pixel.** A packet's colour is:

    RGBC * (BK + LCM * max(0, LLM · N))

followed by the depth cue, a darkening towards the far colour, which is 0 here.
Map tiles take one `NormalColorCol` per face, so **the depth cue is all of a
tile's shading**. `0048` records the chain's inputs per corner and `shade8`
evaluates it per pixel; `light_probe.c` measured the shader against the formula
with a worst difference of 0. See "Per-pixel lighting" in `RENDERING.md`.

### Recommendation: forward, inside `shade8`

**An authored light is one more term in the lit colour, added before the depth
cue and before the texture is modulated.** So:
- it is fogged by the game's own curve;
- it is textured exactly as the game's own light is;
- it saturates where the game's light saturates.

Every other placement gets at least one of those three wrong.

- **Position per fragment:** the view position rebuilt from the recovered depth,
  exactly as `NormalFs` rebuilds it, then turned into world space with the
  camera rotation and position `AoWorld` already uploads. No new vertex
  attribute.
- **Normal per fragment:** the plane from the view position's screen
  derivatives, as `0058` takes it. It is exact for the flat faces the tiles are.
  Gouraud normals for models are a later refinement: the light-dot record would
  also carry the normal.
- **The light list** is culled on the CPU against the camera and the 24×24 window
  every frame, capped at 16, and sent in `RemasterUniforms` by generation, so an
  unchanged list is not re-sent.
- **Receivers:** tiles and models. The first-person arm and anything placed in
  view space (a matrix of 0 in the submitter) are left out unless a light is
  flagged to reach them, because their positions are not in world space.
- **Off is a branch on a count of zero**, so the shader's output with no lights
  is the output it has today. That is proved headless: `light_probe.c` run with
  and without the uniform block, worst difference 0.

### Why not deferred

The surface buffer (`0067`) already holds a normal, a depth and a material at
every pixel, so deferred looks free. **It is not, because the colour it would
relight is final.** The texture has already been multiplied by the lit colour,
clamped and fogged, and water and the other translucents are drawn over it. A
deferred light would have to divide the game's lit term back out per pixel, and
that term saturates. Deferred stays the right place for terms that apply to the
finished picture: a specular highlight along the SSR path, light shafts, bloom.

### Shadows

- **None in the first version.** An authored light lights everything inside its
  radius, which is how the game's own light records behave.
- **What was planned next was a march through the tile grid**, and shadow maps
  were pushed back because drawing the scene from a light meant walking it again:
  the mirrored walk alone costs 1.09–1.12 ms of CPU a frame ("Planar reflections"),
  and the port is CPU-bound.
- **The retained scene (`0072`) removed that cost**, so what shipped is shadow
  maps after all: a depth cubemap per light, drawn on the GPU from the retained map
  with no walk, and drawn again only when the light or the map changes. Exact to
  the mesh, where a grid march would have been whole tiles. See "Shadows, the first
  slice". Creatures and objects cast too, from the models the retained scene
  captures each frame, drawn over a copy of the map's cubemap only while one in
  reach moves; see "Shadows, the second slice".

### The game's own light and fog, authored through the game

**The cheapest and most faithful remaster edit is to the game's own lighting
data.** Stage 1 copies the area's 80 light records from `0x800679A0` into
`0x801930F0` every frame; `TintHold`'s C# stage 1 does the copy (see "The tints
strobed between ticks" in `PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`). Each 104-byte record carries
the light matrix, the colour matrix, the back colour and the depth cue, and
`func_80031950` picks one per tile by `+4 & 0x3F`.

An override applied right after that copy runs through the game's own code, and
through `0048` unchanged, so it is exact whether per-pixel lighting is on or off.
**Inferred**: nothing but rendering reads those records. That has to be confirmed
with `scripts/find_writers.py` and a read census before an override ships.

Fog colour is the GTE's far colour, measured at 0, which is why the fog darkens
to black rather than fading to a colour. A fog colour is one term in `shade8`'s
output, added past the texture by the depth cue's own weight, so the result is a
`mix` towards the colour instead of a multiply towards black. See "Phase 5, the
second slice".

## Level editing: what can be edited and what can only be decorated

**The split is whether the game's own logic reads it.** If the game reads it, an
edit changes gameplay, and it is a level edit. If only the renderer reads it, it
is decoration.

### Edited: the tile bytes, because the game reads them

The 80×80 block at `0x801C8484`, applied when the area settles, after the
fingerprint is taken, and applied again whenever the area is entered.

| byte of a half | what | read by |
|---|---|---|
| `+0` | model index; `0xFF` empty, drawn below 240 | `func_80031B1C` (the renderer), `CullGrid` |
| `+1` | height; the floor is `-(h) << 7` | `func_80031B1C`, the floor queries `func_8002B6B4` and `func_8002C3A8` |
| `+2` | collision flags, `& 0xFC` | `func_8002C700` |
| `+3` | collision-shape index into `0x801D8484` | `func_8002B7D0` |
| `+4` | flags: bit `0x80` stops the visibility flood; the low six bits pick the light record | `CullGrid`, `func_80031950` |

Limits that follow from the format and cannot be designed away:
- **Heights move in steps of 128 units.**
- **A tile can only show a mesh the area already has.**
- **Collision shapes come from a 0x600-byte block**, so a new shape is a slot
  in that block, if one is free.
- **The game's own tile rewrites win.** A door, the drawbridge or the minecart
  rewrites its tiles at run time, so an edit to one of those tiles is undone by
  the game. The editor flags such tiles from the rewrite census.
- **Confirmed: none of the tile block is written into a save, and it is re-read
  from the disc on every area load** (see "The tile block never reaches a save").
  Level edits are still marked gameplay-changing, because they are.

The test for an edit is the invariant the map already prints. Stand on the edited
tile with `goto`; `state` must give a floor gap of 0 at the new height. Walk into
an edited wall with `press`; the position must not cross it.

### Edited with a warning: placement of objects and creatures

**Dropped (2026-09-28).** Not built, and not in the roadmap: a remaster pack does
not move the game's own objects or creatures. Props cover placing a model for its
look without touching a record the game reads or saves. What follows is kept as
the reason, should it ever come back.

Objects at `rec+0x14` in the table at `0x80177714`; creatures at `rec+0x2C` in the
table at `0x8016C544`. **`func_800492B8` packs the 200-slot creature table into
the save buffer** when the player saves. A moved creature is therefore written
into the player's save, where it outlives the pack and stays after the pack is
switched off. That is the one kind of edit that can change a player's game
permanently. It is last in the roadmap, opt-in per pack, and labelled on the
Remaster packs page.

### Decorated: everything only the renderer reads

- materials, lights, fog, sky, and the light-record overrides;
- **port-drawn props**: submitted through the game's own model submitter into the
  frame's ordering table, so they get depth, fog, per-pixel lighting and
  reflections the same way the game's own models do. They have no collision, and
  are said to have none. This is the only way to add geometry. The first slice
  places the area's own object models ("Phase 8, the first slice"); meshes the
  author supplies are later.

### Pushed back

- **Replacing creature meshes.** A creature is an MO morph, a base TMD plus
  packed vertex deltas per clip (see "The model pipeline has no skeleton" in
  `GAME_INTERNALS.md`). A replacement would have to carry matching morph targets
  for every clip. That is a modelling pipeline, not an authoring tool.
- **New walkable geometry** beyond what tiles and collision shapes can express.
- **Lifting the 24-tile draw window.** Already measured as binding and barely
  worth it; see "Is the 24-tile window worth lifting?" in `WIDESCREEN.md`.

## Rules every phase keeps

- **Off is bit-identical, and it is proved three ways**, depending on what the
  feature touches:
  1. `snap … hash`, feature off, against a build without the feature, at a pinned
     view: the world paused, `goto x y z yaw pitch`, at `KF2_AUTOSTART=new` and
     at `KF2_AUTOSTART=2`;
  2. `shader_probe.c` or `light_probe.c` for any shader branch;
  3. `KF2_*=verify` for any C# routine a feature adds to (`KF2_POLYASM`,
     `KF2_TILEWALK`, `KF2_MODELWALK`), with 0 RAM, register and GTE mismatches.
- **144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s**, measured with
  `KF2_FPS=144 KF2_FPS_PROBE=1 KF2_PRESENT_PROBE=1`. Each feature's cost is taken
  from the frame profiler, on and off. GPU time comes from a frame capture's
  `GL_TIME_ELAPSED` queries, since frame rate cannot see GPU cost on a CPU-bound
  port.
- **Features ship off; no pack is enabled by default; the repository ships none
  switched on.** The remaster never breaks faithfulness by default.
- **Every feature has a `KF2_REMASTER_<ID>` switch and a probe line**, both listed
  in `ENV_VARS.md`.
- **Hooks attach through `HookAttach`** and read back `IsCommitted`, as every patch
  does (see "A registration is not a hook" in `PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`).

## The phased roadmap

Each phase is usable on its own. For each one this lists what ships, what it
depends on, the risks, the counter that proves the mechanism, and what the user
has to look at, because nobody else can.

### Phase 1: an authored material on a floor, end to end

**The smallest slice that exercises every layer:** one material placed in the
editor, saved, reloaded and rendered. A material, not a light, because the
reflection pass already reads `SurfaceMaterial` and `GtePacketDepth.Rec.Material`
already exists, so **no new runtime patch is needed**. The whole slice is
port-side. (Wrong by one amendment to `0067`; see "Phase 1, the first slice".)

**Status:** [x] done and measured, [~] done in part, [ ] not started.

- **Ships:**
  - [x] `Identity` with area, fingerprint and tile half only;
  - [x] `TileWalk` publishing the half it is assembling (`x, z, half`), the way
    `ModelWalk.SetSubmit` publishes a model;
  - [x] `PolyAssemblerDepth.SealDepth` writing `Rec.Material` from a table the
    surfaces feature fills;
  - [x] `SurfaceMaterial.Reflectivity`/`F0` filled from `materials.json`;
  - [x] the pack loader (the working pack only);
  - [~] a minimal editor: tile pick by ray and from the map panel, a material
    inspector, save, reload, live reload, undo -- all in, driven over the shell
    and used by hand to place the first mirror floor;
  - [x] the `edit`, `select`, `set`, `pack` and `snap` shell verbs (`snap` in the
    second slice, reading the presented target through `0069`);
  - [x] the Remaster packs settings page, and the switch under Video ▸
    Enhancements (the second slice).
- **Depends on:** reflections being switched on (`KF2_SSR=1`), since that is the
  only reader of a material today.
- **Risks:**
  - the eight material ids. The slice needs one; if it needs more, the `0067`
    amendment moves into this phase;
  - SSR's water assumptions (the fog curve, the sky fallback) may look wrong on
    a floor. That is for the eye to judge, and it is useful to learn early.
- **Mechanism measured by:**
  - [x] `SurfaceMaterial.FromPacket` and `ByMaterial[id]` rising for the authored id;
  - [~] the SSR readback's reflective share with the tile in view -- the id shows
    in the readback's map, but the only tile tried was the water surface, so the
    share could not move;
  - [x] the same tile key resolving after a `warp` out and back, after `load 2`, and
    after a restart;
  - [x] the fingerprint identical across those -- once `+2` was left out of it;
  - [x] `snap` identical to baseline with the pack disabled (the second slice);
  - [x] `KF2_POLYASM=verify` and `KF2_TILEWALK=verify` clean;
  - [x] 144.0 at 20.0.
- **You look at** (the first judged: a dry tile at reflectivity 1 reads as a
  mirror, placed correctly):
  - whether the floor reads as polished stone or as a mirror;
  - whether the reflection's fog and sky fallback look wrong on something that
    is not water;
  - whether the editor is usable: picking, the inspector, the save round trip;
  - [ ] a floor at a partial reflectivity, and a larger area of floor.
- **Cost:** one table read per sealed tile packet while on, one bool while off.

### Phase 1, the first slice

**What is in.** Everything in the Ships list above except `snap`, the Remaster
packs settings page and the camera-free parts of the editor's gizmos:

- `patches/remaster/Identity.cs` — area, fingerprint, the settle test, `TileKey`
  (`tile:A:X:Z:lower|upper`), record address to key and back.
- `TileWalk.CurrentRecord` — the half `func_80031950` is assembling, set around the
  assembler call. `PolyAssembler.TileMaterial` is what `Surfaces` resolved for it,
  and `SealDepth` writes it into `GtePacketDepth.Rec.Material` for every packet it
  seals, clipped fans included. A material therefore needs the C# half
  (`KF2_TILEWALK_TILE=0` authors nothing).
- `patches/remaster/Pack.cs` — the working pack (`remaster-packs/working`, or
  `KF2_REMASTER_PACK`), `materials.json` and `areas/<n>/surfaces.json` kept as JSON
  trees so unknown fields survive, upstream's `pack.json` written once, a
  `FileSystemWatcher` whose parse is swapped in at the next VSync, and one undo stack.
- `patches/remaster/Surfaces.cs` — the one `IRemasterFeature` so far: names to ids
  from `SurfaceMaterial.FirstAuthored`, the fingerprint gate, an 80×80×2 id table.
- `patches/remaster/Pick.cs` — the game's projection both ways: the view matrix at
  `0x80192E18` less the camera (whose 16-bit X and Z are unwrapped against the
  player's), and `GteDepth.ProjH`/`ProjCx`/`ProjCy`. A floor ray is walked cell by
  cell through the grid; walls are not read, so a ray can pass through one.
- `patches/remaster/Editor.cs` — Shift+E; pauses the world; picks by a click on the
  picture, by right-click in the docked map, or as the player's tile; outlines the
  selection; a material library with reflectivity and F0 sliders (one undo entry per
  drag); Save, Reload, Undo, Redo.
- `patches/remaster/Shell.cs` — `edit`, `select`, `set`, `pack`, `remaster` on
  `KF2_SHELL`, through the same calls the panel makes.

**The runtime needed one change after all, an amendment to `0067`.** `NormalFs`
decided opacity from the id (`vM < 1.5`), so any authored id on an opaque floor
would have taken that floor out of the occlusion pass's normals. Opacity now
travels with the triangle; every existing id is drawn as before. The design's claim
that Phase 1 needs no runtime patch was wrong by exactly this.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=new`, `KF2_SSR=1`, area 0 in `fdat02`):
- The authored id reaches the classifier and the surface buffer:
  `SurfaceMaterial.ByMaterial[4]` and `FromPacket` rise together (4,032 in one
  window), about 4,600 authored packets a second for two tiles in view.
- The pick and the projection agree with the picture: `select pick 160 200` chose
  tile 37,45, and the SSR readback's material map then showed the new id in the
  cells covering game pixels 115-169 by 195-210. Picks follow the player's heading.
- Tile 37,45 is **the water surface itself** — the water is a tile, drawn blended by
  the tile assembler — so a packet material there replaces `Water` and the pixels
  stay reflective (the readback's reflective share did not move, 36.3%). It is also
  the amendment's test: a blended tile with an authored id stays translucent.
- **The first fingerprint was too strict.** Area 0 read `75069e…` from a New Game
  and `fab65f…` entered from save slot 2. The probe's diff: 32 empty lower halves
  (model `FF`) in two 4×4 blocks, `+2` bit `0x04` set in one and cleared in the
  other, nothing else different. Something four tiles square moves between the two
  saves and stamps its footprint into the collision flags; the ship by the shore is
  the obvious candidate (**Inferred**). With `+2` left out, area 0 reads
  `3f7d7b45edcbda59` from both, and area 1 `49930d41f830e0a3` across two loads and
  an auto-reload.
- **The fingerprint moved with the game's progress.** Reported from play: area 1
  refused a pack authored against `b6770a…` once the player had been elsewhere,
  reading `5056f1…`. Measured from slot 2: area 1 read `49930d…` on entry and
  `49787d…` after leaving for area 2 and coming back, and flipped back again on a
  reload. The probe's diff, with the ignored `+2` taken out: 12 upper halves at
  10-13 × 47-49, `+3` (the collision shape) `75` → `32`/`33` and `+4` losing bit
  `0x40`, and no collision-shape byte. The game rewrites a door's or a lift's tiles
  as it plays, and that state travels with the save, so **no live reading is the
  area's identity**. The fingerprint is now taken from `func_8001689C`'s source
  buffer as `func_80017244` copies it (a pre-hook matching the destination and the
  word count). Measured after: area 1 `be64c93e02071c09` on entry, after areas 2
  and 3, and after reloads from slots 1, 3 and 2, while the live block went on
  flipping; area 0 `58d4e515d1aea80a`, area 2 `f6f8cec2c5dc7135`, area 3
  `370ef222844b0ee9`. The values below are the old live readings and no longer
  match anything.
- A pack authored against the old fingerprint was refused whole, with the reason on
  the panel and in `remaster`; editing the file's fingerprint by hand applied it
  through the watcher with no restart.
- A hand edit adding a material with an unknown field (`roughness`) and a root field
  reloaded live and survived the next save.
- `KF2_TILEWALK=verify KF2_POLYASM=verify` with materials applied: 1,297 reports,
  all 0 RAM, register and GTE mismatches.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s, `[present] wide 288`, vertex map 97.1% hit, with
  the remaster on. `set remaster off` in the same run: sealed packets stop, the
  authored id's count stops growing.
- **Off costs one test a frame** (`Host.Frame` returns before reading anything) and
  one byte store per sealed packet, which writes the `None` the record always held.

**Not measured, and why** (at the time; the second slice built `snap`). `snap` is not built: `GpuHle.Backend.ReadVram` reads 1×
VRAM, and the reflection pass composites at present, after VRAM, so a VRAM hash
cannot see what a material changes. `snap` has to read the presented target, which
is a runtime hook (`GlCore.PresentDisplay`) — next. Until then "off is
bit-identical" rests on the record holding `None` with the switch off and on the
amendment keeping every existing id's opacity, both read from the code.

**Looked at.** One dry floor tile in area 0, set to reflectivity 1 through the
editor, judged good as a first step: it reads as a mirror of the doorway and the
wall above it, in the right place and the right way up. The editor was used end to
end to get there (pick, material, sliders). Still to judge: a floor at a *partial*
reflectivity (does it read as polished stone), and a larger area of floor. The
same screenshot shows a speckled fringe along the reflected wall edge; that is the
reflection pass's march, not the material, and is in `docs/TODO.md`'s open
questions.

**Next.** Taken in the second slice, below: `snap`, the settings, and picks that
stop.

### Phase 1, the second slice

**What is in.** The three things the first slice left for next:

- **`snap`** (`patches/remaster/Snap.cs`, runtime `0069`). `snap [hash | PATH.png]
  [after N] [buffer Y|any]` reads the picture the window is drawn from -- after the
  occlusion, the reflections and any post shader, at the render scale -- hashes it
  (SHA-256, the first sixteen hex digits), counts the pixels that differ from the
  previous snap with their largest channel difference and bounding rectangle, and
  writes a PNG when given a path. It waits two presents by default, so an edit made
  by the command before it has been drawn and presented. The reply is sent from the
  present that was read, so `AgentServer` hands `snap` its reply rather than
  answering it at the VSync drain.
- **The settings.** Video ▸ Enhancements gains *Remaster packs*, the saved switch
  (`kf2.remaster.on`, the same key the editor's checkbox writes; `KF2_REMASTER`
  still overrides it). Under it a *Remaster packs* heading lists the working pack:
  its root, its materials, every area it holds with the fingerprint that area was
  authored against, and for the area now loaded whether it applies or why not.
  Only the working pack exists, so the list is one entry; layering is Phase 7's.
- **Picks that stop** (since replaced by a pick from the frame's triangles; see
  "Faces, picked from the frame"). `Pick.Floor` now stops a ray at a tile with no drawn floor
  (rock) and at a tile whose lowest floor is above the ray where it enters (a step
  up), and says which: `select pick` answers `no floor under that pixel: a step up
  at 44,47`. The eye's own tile is never a stop.

**The wall flag is not a wall.** The plan was to stop at `+4` bit `0x80`, which
`AoWorld` and `CullGrid` read as the tile that stops the visibility flood. Measured
over the 12×12 tiles around the New Game spawn in area 0: **every one** of them
carries it, on both halves, water, shore and sea floor alike. Stopping on it
stopped every pick at the tile next to the player. So the grid has no wall a ray
can read here, only floors, and a real wall -- one standing on a floor, with floor
beyond it at the same height -- still lets a pick through. The depth buffer is the
exact answer (the picture's own nearest surface under the cursor), and it is
where picking goes if this is not enough; `AoWorld`'s comment calling the bit a
wall is **Open** for the same reason.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=new`, `KF2_SSR=1`, area 0 in `fdat02`, 144 fps,
render scale 5, 16:9: a 2140×1200 picture):
- **A paused frame is repeatable.** Three snaps in a row, same hash. The two
  display buffers are not: at `0,0` and `0,240` the same paused frame differed in
  4 pixels by up to 3 levels, so a snap takes the buffer the last one took (the one
  at row 0 first) and says which in `buffer`.
- **Off is bit-identical.** With nothing authored, `set remaster off` and `set
  remaster on` gave the same hash (`8661b58c3cd089e9`). With a mirror on the tile
  a pick chose, off went back to the unauthored hash and on to the authored one,
  both ways round.
- **A pick lands where it was clicked.** `select pick 140 238` chose
  `tile:0:35:47:upper`; a mirror there changed 3,881 pixels (0.15%) by up to 3
  levels, all inside render pixels 900-1069 by 1151-1199 -- game pixels 126-160
  by 230-240, around the click. A mirror on the water tile under `200 238`
  changed 46,874 pixels in a rectangle round that one.
- **A mirror can change nothing, and that is not the pack failing.** In one view
  straight after the area loaded the same mirror on 35,47 moved no pixel at all,
  while its packets rose (2,072 in two seconds, `ByMaterial[4]` with them). A
  floor at the bottom edge reflects upwards and out of the picture; a ray that
  finds nothing and crosses no background pixel adds nothing. The SSR readback
  (`KF2_SSR_PROBE=1`) is what tells "not applied" from "nothing to reflect".
- 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s, `[present] wide 288, plain 0, vram fallback 0`,
  with the remaster on and after a dozen snaps. **Off costs one null test a
  present**; a snap costs one `glReadPixels` of the picture and a hash, once.

**Not judged.** The settings page and the editor's new "No floor there" line have
not been looked at. The pick's stops are checked against the grid only: whether a
click on a cliff face or a bank reads as "nothing picked" rather than "wrong tile"
is for the eye.

**Next.** The texture-key census (Phase 4) can start independently; Phase 2's
light term is next on the main line and needs nothing more from Phase 1.

### A tile half is a whole mesh, and a face is the key under it

**Reported from play: a material on a floor tile put the ceiling above it in the
mirror too.** Nothing is wrong with the pick. A tile half draws one mesh, and in a
cave that mesh is the tile's whole column: floor, ceiling and the rock between.
`TileWalk` sets the half's material around the assembler call, so every packet the
mesh makes carries it. The key table's "one floor or ceiling surface" was never
what the code did.

**Neither facing nor texture separates them.** Faceted rock points every way, so
a normal threshold cuts it at arbitrary seams, and nothing promises that a floor
and a wall use different textures. The face itself does: a mesh is a fixed list
of polygons, and `func_80030540`, `func_8002FECC` and the clipped fans all walk it
in order, so `(tile half, mesh, face index)` names one polygon on every path.

**The subdivider keeps the order.** Read from `func_80030C94`: it walks the
source faces in order and writes each one's pieces contiguously. A quad or a
triangle (`0x2C`, `0x2E`, `0x24`, `0x26`) becomes four, and anything else is
copied as one. So an output face maps back to its source face by counting.

**Measured** (`KF2_FACE_PROBE=1`, `patches/remaster/FaceProbe.cs`; `KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 in
`fdat05`, `KF2_SSR=1`, eight cameras through `view`). Every tile face was given one
of the ids 4-7 by a hash of its key, and the reflection probe's readback holds the
id per pixel:
- **The mapping.** 763k source faces over 15 meshes, 11.9M output vertices: 0
  count, command, CLUT or tpage mismatches. Every output vertex lies inside its
  source face's box, and every source corner reappears in its four pieces. No
  copied (non-splitting) face occurred, so that branch is read from the code only.
- **A pick from the frame's own triangles.** Every sealed packet was recorded
  with its key, its screen corners and its depths. The nearest triangle under a
  point was then compared with the GPU's id at that pixel. At face centroids it
  agreed 100% once the view had settled. On a 6-pixel grid it agreed 98-100%, and
  almost every disagreement lay within 2 px of the picked triangle's edge.
- **The one interior disagreement is overlapping geometry.** In one view, a band
  near the camera went to a different face than the nearest one. Two neighbouring
  tiles' meshes overlap there: face 1 of `801CF667` and face 1 of `801CF671` cover
  the same pixels 1 unit of depth apart. With the depth tolerance off
  (`KF2_ZBUFFER_BIAS=0 KF2_ZBUFFER_SLOPE=0`) the band stays, so the depth test's
  own fight decides it, not the tolerance.

**What follows for the design.** Key materials by face. Pick by the frame's
triangles, and when faces lie within the depth tolerance under the cursor, select
all of them: which one wins there changes per pixel and per angle, so an author
cannot see one without the other anyway.

### Faces, picked from the frame

**What is in.** Materials are authored per face, and a click picks faces:

- `patches/remaster/Faces.cs` -- the face being assembled (`Faces.Enter`, from
  both of `PolyAssembler`'s face loops), the subdivider's output mapped back by
  counting (`Faces.Subdivided`, refused whole if the count does not come out), the
  frame's triangles recorded at `SealDepth` while the editor is open, the pick,
  and the meshes: faces, a structural hash, and the grow queries.
- `Surfaces` resolves four levels per face: the half's face list, the whole half,
  the mesh's face list, the whole mesh. `TileWalk` asks for the half
  (`Surfaces.EnterHalf`) and `Faces` for each face, and only while something
  below the whole half is authored (`Surfaces.PerFace`).
- `Pack` keeps face lists on tile entries and area-wide rules under `meshes`, each
  with `mesh` and `meshHash`. A face edit is one undo entry, undone by putting the
  area's document back.
- The editor picks faces on a click (Shift+click adds or removes), grows a
  selection (*Connected*: joined by an edge and the same texture; *Same texture*;
  *Whole mesh*), selects the whole half, assigns at the half or, with *Every tile
  with this mesh*, at the mesh, and tints the selection's triangles over the
  picture. The map panel and the player's tile still select a whole half.
- Shell: `select pick GX GY [add]`, `select faces F,F,...`,
  `select grow connected|texture|mesh`, `set selected material NAME|none [tile|mesh]`;
  a selection's reply carries `sealedIds`, what the last frame sealed each of the
  half's faces with.
- `Pick.cs` is gone, and with it the second slice's picks that stop at rock.

**The mesh table pointer moves within a frame.** `0x8018E19C` points at the tile
meshes only while the tile walk runs; the object walk repoints it at the models',
so read at VSync it named nonsense (mesh 1's face count `0x00100008`). The walk
notes it for every half (`Faces.TileTable`), meshes are read from that, and
`Surfaces` re-applies when it moves. Its `+4` word is the far-model limit, not a
count.

**The mesh hash** is the face count and each face's command, length and corners:
the structure a face index means, not its texture or where its vertices are, so
a scrolling UV cannot move it. A face list whose mesh no longer hashes the same is
dropped whole, and the editor says so.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 in `fdat05`, a scratch pack, `KF2_SSR=1`):
- A click on the floor in front of the player picked `tile:1:36:36:upper:1`
  (mesh 1, four faces). Authored as a mirror, the last frame sealed face 1 with id 4
  and faces 0, 2 and 3 with 0, and the picture changed in rows 559-1117 of 1200
  only. The same material on the whole half sealed all four faces and reached row
  35, the ceiling. Undo returned the face-only picture to the same hash.
- *Connected* grew face 1 to faces 1 and 3.
- A mesh rule on face 1 of mesh 1 reached the two other mesh-1 tiles in view and
  left a mesh-27 tile alone.
- After a restart the saved pack sealed the same ids. A hand-edited `meshHash`
  dropped that face list (`meshRefused: 1`) through the watcher, and the mesh rule
  still covered the face.
- The pick against the GPU (`KF2_FACE_PROBE=1`, nine cameras through `view`):
  about 20,200 grid samples, no interior disagreement, and 46 (0.23%) within 2 px
  of a triangle edge. Selecting the coplanar faces too took the overlapping view
  from 56 disagreements to 3.
- `KF2_TILEWALK=verify KF2_POLYASM=verify` with face lists applied: 162 reports, all
  0 RAM, register and GTE mismatches. 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s,
  `[present] wide 288, plain 0, vram fallback 0`.
- **Cost:** nothing authored below the half, one bool per face. Authored, a few
  array reads per face. Recording runs only while the editor or the probe is open.

**Not judged.** The editor's new controls and the selection tint have not been
looked at, and neither has whether *Connected* grows to what an author means on
faceted rock.

**Every "click" above was the shell's `select pick`, and the window's own click
never worked.** Reported from play: neither *Pick on the picture* nor *Place on the
picture* did anything. The editor gated a click on `!io.WantCaptureMouse`, but the
picture is drawn inside the Output panel, an ImGui window, so ImGui wants the mouse
whenever the pointer is over it: the gate was shut exactly where it should open.
`OutputView.Hovered` (`0029`, amended) is the picture's own `IsItemHovered`, which
is also false when another panel or a popup is in front of it. The click through
the window is **not yet confirmed by hand**.

**Typing reached the hotkeys.** A key typed into a text field (a material's name)
also arrives on the `KeyboardEvent` bus, so an `m` opened the map. The port's
hotkeys now ask `patches/HotkeyGate.cs`: Shift+E, Shift+P and Shift+F wait while
ImGui has a text field focused, and M, N and the mouse-capture key also wait while
the editor is open. `mods/kf2debug`'s F-keys are left alone, since nothing types
them.

### Phase 2: authored point and spot lights (`0071`)

- **Ships:**
  - [x] `RemasterUniforms` and the light list;
  - [x] the light term in `shade8` (core `PrimFs`);
  - [x] the light gizmo and inspector: a dot and a reach ring per light, a drag
    across the screen at the light's depth (Shift: up and down in height steps),
    axis arrows on the selected light, depth cues drawn in the world (see "The
    light gizmo is drawn in the world"), and the inspector;
  - [x] `lights.json`;
  - [x] flicker, evaluated on the world tick so it holds with the world;
  - [~] a probe counting lights culled, uploaded and lit batches (not fragments).
- **Depends on:** Phase 1's pack, editor and `snap`; per-pixel lighting on
  (`0048`), since the term lives in `shade8`.
- **Risks:**
  - fragment cost at high render scales. `PrimFs` runs for overdraw too, under
    painter's order;
  - the derivative normal at silhouettes;
  - light on the first-person arm.
- **Mechanism measured by:**
  - `light_probe.c` extended with a light: the term against a C reference, and 0
    lights bit-identical to today;
  - the probe's light and receiver counts;
  - frame profiler and GPU timers at 0, 1, 4 and 16 lights, at render scale 1
    and 5.
- **You look at:** falloff and colour; how a light reads through the fog; a
  creature walking through a light; the look at the edge of the radius.

### Phase 2, the first slice

**What is in.** Point and spot lights, authored per area, drawn by the game's own
lighting chain:

- **Runtime `0071`**: `Gpu/RemasterUniforms.cs` holds up to 16 lights already in
  the GTE's view space, with a generation; `GlCore` uploads the list when the
  generation moves and flushes a batch built under the previous one. `PrimFs`
  gains `authored()`: the fragment's view position rebuilt from its recovered
  depth, H and the centre exactly as `NormalFs` does, its normal from that
  position's screen derivatives, and per light `colour * max(N·L, 0) * (1 -
  d²/r²)² * spot`, the spot a smoothstep between the cone's two cosines. `shade8`
  adds it times the packet's RGBC to the lit colour, **before** the depth cue, so
  the game's fog darkens it, the texture is modulated by it and it saturates
  where the game's light does. Not drawn into a planar reflection's texture, whose
  view is the mirrored camera's.
- **What a light reaches**: a packet with a `0048` record and a recovered depth.
  So map tiles, clipped fans and models, including the first-person arm (its
  position is rebuilt in view space like everything else, so the design's worry
  about view-space receivers does not arise). The HUD and anything unrecorded keep
  their vertex colour. Per-pixel lighting and Fast geometry must be on.
- **The record carries RGBC now.** A tile's, a clipped fan's and a flat model
  face's record had `0` in the low bytes, which only a directional record read;
  they carry the light colour word at `0x8006E604` that `NormalColorCol` lit them
  with. And with lights applied, a face drawn with no fog at all keeps its record
  (`PolyAssembler.KeepUnfogged`), where before it was dropped as interpolating
  the same; without a record it could not be lit.
- `patches/remaster/Lights.cs`: the area's `lights.json` behind the fingerprint;
  before each `DrawOTag` (the camera block then holds the view the table was
  built with) every light goes to view space as `R (w - cam) + T`, is culled
  behind the eye and past twelve tiles, and the nearest 16 are published. Flicker
  is value noise on a tick count taken with `FramePacing.FirstWalkOfTick`.
- The editor gains a Lights section: *Add at eye*, *Place on the picture* (the
  next click adds one 192 units short of the nearest surface the last frame drew
  there, from `Faces`' triangles), a list, and the inspector: type, position,
  colour, intensity, radius, direction and cones, flicker, on, move to eye,
  delete. Each light is drawn over the picture; a click on its dot selects it and
  a drag moves it. A held slider or drag is one undo entry.
- Shell: `light list | add NAME [here | pick GX GY | X Y Z] | remove | select |
  set NAME FIELD V...`; `list` gives each light's projected pixel and depth, and
  the counters. `KF2_REMASTER_LIGHTS=0` leaves the pack's lights out.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 in `fdat05`, a scratch pack, 144 fps,
render scale 5, 16:9):
- **The term is the formula.** `scripts/light_probe.c` runs the real `PrimFs`
  with three lights (two points and a spot) over a wall at a known depth and
  compares every pixel with the same formula in C: worst difference **0** over
  all nine strips. With no light uploaded, and with lights uploaded but no depth,
  the strips are 0 from 0048's formula as before.
- **Off is the picture it was.** At a pinned view, `set remaster off` gave the
  hash of the frame before any light was added (`210d55698c875fb8`), and so did
  switching the light off with `light set ... enabled off`; undo went back to the
  earlier lit hash.
- **A pick places the light where it was clicked**: `light add warm pick 160 170`
  projected back to game pixel `160.1,170.1` at depth 1447. The brightest changed
  pixel was at `170,172`, and it followed the light through four more cameras
  through `view` -- yaw ±100, pitch 150, and the eye moved 800 units -- at 9-19
  pixels from the light's own projection, the offset the surface's slope gives.
  No pixel ever got darker.
- Radius 1024 changed 27.9% of the picture inside one rectangle round the light;
  4096 changed 97.9%.
- Flicker ran at 20 steps a second with the world, and three snaps with the
  editor open were identical.
- A restart read the saved `lights.json` and sent both lights. Under
  `KF2_POLYASM=verify KF2_TILEWALK=verify` with them applied: 2,517 reports, all 0
  RAM, register and GTE mismatches.
- **Cost**, 16 lights against none at render scale 5 (2140×1200): the frame's GPU
  batches 0.51 → 0.69 ms by the frame capture's timers (0.97 in a noisier first
  capture), CPU work 0.96 → 0.99 ms a frame, 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s
  either way, `[present] wide 288`. Off, one test a frame and one `int` compare
  per triangle.

**Not judged.** Nothing about the look: falloff, colour, how a light reads in the
fog, the edge of the radius, a creature walking through one. Nor the editor's
Lights section, the gizmos and the drag. Render scale 1 was not measured, and
neither was a light on the arm.

### The light gizmo is drawn in the world

A dot and a screen-facing ring said where a light was on the screen and nothing
about how far away it was, so placing one meant moving it and looking for where the
light landed. The gizmo is drawn in the world now, projected through the frame's own
view (`Lights.View`) and cut at the near plane, so perspective carries the depth:

- every light's reach is a ring flat at its own height, and a line drops from it to
  the floor below with a small ring where it lands -- the nearer below it of its
  tile's two halves' floors (`-(h << 7)`, the height `PropPlaceAt` stands a prop
  on); the selected light's label gives its height above that floor;
- the dot is 96 world units across, held to 3-9 pixels, so a far light is small;
- a spot is its outer cone, to its reach when selected and 1024 units otherwise,
  and the inner cone's rim;
- the selected light's reach is a sphere of three rings, and it has an arrow per
  world axis (X red, Y green and pointing up, which is -Y, Z blue), 70 window pixels
  long at any distance. An arrow drags the light along its axis: the point on the
  axis nearest the mouse's ray from the eye, less where it was grabbed, so the light
  stays under the cursor; Ctrl snaps to a height step. The dot inside 12 pixels of
  the centre is still the drag across the screen.

**Judged** in play: it looks right. Nothing about it is measured, since it is
the editor's overlay and reaches no frame the game draws.

### Phase 3: the material system proper

- **Ships:**
  - [x] the `0067` amendment: ids widened to 256 (the `RGBA16F` alpha holds them
    exactly); the table stayed `SurfaceMaterial`'s, as a texture, not in
    `RemasterUniforms`;
  - [~] materials keyed by tile mesh (Phase 1's faces), model (in) and texture
    index hash (not started: it waits on Phase 4's key census);
  - [x] emissive, which adds to the lit term the way a light does, and roughness,
    which only SSR reads, as a blur of its hit;
  - [x] metalness, specular, occlusion, a light of its own, pulse and unfogged glow
    (the second slice).
- **Mechanism measured by:** the `ByMaterial` census for every source; the
  reflection census identical with no pack; `shader_probe.c` for emissive
  (`light_probe.c` in the event, since the term is `0071`'s).
- **You look at:** emissive surfaces in the dark areas; how roughness looks on
  SSR.

### Phase 3, the first slice

**What is in.** Two material properties, a key, and the table they need:

- **Runtime, `0067` amended**: `SurfaceMaterial.Count` 256, `BlendedFlag` 256,
  `Roughness`, `Emissive`, `Generation` and `Changed()`. `GlCore` uploads the table
  as a 256×2 RGBA32F texture when the generation moves: row 0 reflectivity, F0 and
  roughness for `SsrFs`, row 1 the emissive colour for `PrimFs`.
- **Roughness** is a blur of the reflection, not a jittered ray: nine taps over the
  footprint of the cone the reflected ray stands for, `roughness × distance`
  across at the hit's depth, skipping taps under the HUD or off the picture. A
  planar lookup takes its distance from the planar texture's depth. 0 is the single
  read it was.
- **Emissive, `0071` amended**: the packet's material rides in the light buffer
  (attribute 11), and `PrimFs` adds its row-1 colour to the authored term, before
  the depth cue and times the packet's RGBC, so a glow is fogged and textured like
  the game's own light and strength 1 shows the texture at full. It needs no depth,
  so it is drawn into a planar reflection too. Only a packet with a `0048` record
  glows, which needs per-pixel lighting and Fast geometry.
- **The first thing that did not work**: a glowing model changed no pixel. A face
  with no fog at all keeps no light record (it interpolates the same per pixel), and
  near the eye that is every face; only authored lights kept them
  (`PolyAssembler.KeepUnfogged`). It is now kept for either reason, each owned by
  its feature (`KeepForLights`, `KeepForGlow`), and only while the area has a
  glowing material applied.
- **Models**: `ModelWalk`'s submitter asks `Surfaces.EnterModel(kind, model)` before
  the assembler call and `SealDepth` writes the id as it does for a tile.
  `surfaces.json` gains `models`, keyed by kind and model id. `Faces` records a
  model's triangles with both, so a click on a model selects it; the editor tints
  its triangles and gives it the material combo. Nothing is keyed by instance.
- The editor's library gains *Roughness*, *Emissive* (a colour) and *Glow* (0-4);
  a colour held is one undo entry. Shell: `select model:A:KIND:ID`, `select pick`
  answering a model, `set model:... material NAME`, `set material:NAME
  roughness|emissiveStrength V` and `emissive R G B`; `pack list` shows models and
  the new fields; `remaster` gives `byMaterial` as only the ids drawn, the table's
  uploads and whether anything glows.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 in `fdat05`, `KF2_SSR=1`, a scratch pack,
144 fps, render scale 5, 16:9, the view pinned with the editor open):
- **The formula.** `light_probe.c` adds three passes: glow on with material 0,
  glow on with a glowing material and no depth, glow off with the same material.
  Worst difference from the formula 0 in all six passes; the first and third new
  ones are the program as `0071` left it, to the bit.
- **Off is the picture it was.** With nothing authored, remaster on and off gave
  `210d55698c875fb8`, the hash Phase 2 recorded at this view before this change, so
  moving the table into a texture moved no pixel.
- **A model glows, and only it.** `select pick 180 100` chose
  `model:1:object:486` (63 triangles). At glow 1.5 the picture changed in 11.1% of
  its pixels, by up to 153 levels, all inside render pixels 930-1378 by 0-912, the
  model's rectangle; at 0.5, by up to 94. At glow 0 -- the records kept, the term
  zero -- and with the remaster off, the hash was the baseline's.
- A face of a floor half in area 0 at glow 1.5 changed 3.2% of the picture, all in
  the bottom rows where it lies.
- **Roughness moves only the reflection.** A mirror (reflectivity 1, F0 0.5) on a
  floor face; roughness 0.3 and 1 changed 3.6-3.9% of the picture, inside the
  floor's rectangle, by up to 15-24 levels. Back at 0 the hash was the mirror's own
  again.
- **The saved pack reproduces it.** After a restart, the same view's hash was the
  one before (`22f23314bc315e90`).
- **Verify.** `KF2_POLYASM=verify KF2_TILEWALK=verify` in area 0 with the glowing
  face applied and sealed: 899 reports over the nine routines, all 0 RAM, register
  and GTE mismatches. `KF2_MODELWALK=verify` into area 1 with the glowing model: 72
  reports, one of them 1 RAM mismatch in `func_800331B4`, in area 0 before the save
  loaded (a word at `0x80073DF4`), which is the ambient-sound key-on the walk's
  verify is documented to show ("A verify pass replays, it does not re-run" in
  `PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`) -- **Inferred**, since the probe that counts key-ons was
  not on. The picture under that verify was the normal run's hash. All three
  verifiers together run at 0.2 fps in area 0, too slow to reach a save.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 19.9-20.0 ticks/s in area 1 with the pack applied, and in
  area 0 with the glow on and with the remaster off; `[present] wide 288, plain 0,
  vram fallback 0`. One view in area 0 facing the sea, editor open, read 114 fps;
  it was not compared with the build before this and is not explained.
- **Cost:** nothing glowing, one bool a batch. Glowing, one texel fetch per
  fragment of a recorded packet, and the records of unfogged faces kept, as authored
  lights already do. Roughness 0 costs nothing; above it, eight more reads per
  reflective pixel.

**Not judged.** Most of the look: how a glow reads through the fog, roughness on a
floor mirror and on water, the editor's new controls and the model tint. One glow
was looked at; see below. Under `KF2_MODELWALK=verify` a click cannot pick a model (the last
submit recorded is the recompiled pass's, which names nothing).

**Looked at: glow reads as lit, not glowing.** Judged from play (area 0, a wall
panel at glow 4.0, roughness 1): "it kinda looks like it's glowing, but not quite".
Two causes in the design, neither of them the missing bloom:
- **It multiplies the texture.** The term is added to the lit colour *before*
  the texture is modulated, so glow 4 is "the texture at twice full, clipped": the
  texture's dark blotches stay dark and the panel reads as overexposed stone. Right
  for a lit window; wrong for a light source.
- **Nothing around it is lit.** The floor in front of the panel is as dark as
  anywhere else, and that is the strongest glow cue there is.
- Roughness did nothing in that shot, correctly: it only blurs a reflection, and
  the panel had reflectivity 0.

**Next, for glow** (agreed with the user; 2 and 3 are built, see "The glow is a
light source" below):
1. **Try by hand first**: an authored point light just in front of the panel, the
   glow's colour, radius 1500-3000. The user was to say whether that is much
   closer; if so, build 2 and 3 together.
2. **A glowing material gives off a light.** `Lights` builds the frame's list from
   `Pack.Lights(area)` (`patches/remaster/Lights.cs`, `Resolve` and the publish
   before `DrawOTag`); add derived lights for the area's glowing faces and models.
   A tile face's world position comes from its half (`Identity`: tile X, Z at 2048
   units, the floor at `-(h) << 7`) and the mesh's vertices (`Faces.Mesh`); a
   model's from `ModelWalk.Scene`. The cap is 16 lights, nearest first, so derived
   ones compete with authored ones; decide which wins. Keep it off with no glowing
   material, so off stays bit-identical.
3. **An additive glow mode**: add the emissive colour *after* the texture is
   modulated, so dark texels light too. The term is in `PrimFs`
   (`GlShaders.cs`: `extra += texelFetch(uMatTable, ivec2(int(vMat), 1), 0).rgb`
   in `main`, applied in `shade8`); row 1's alpha of the material table is free for
   a mode flag (`GlCore.BindMaterials`, `SurfaceMaterial.Emissive`). Keep the
   current mode as the other choice, extend `scripts/light_probe.c` for the new
   one, and amend `0071` (a correction to its own term, not a new mechanism).
4. Bloom is a pass on the finished picture, a separate feature, later.

**Next, otherwise.** The texture key needs Phase 4's census before anything is keyed
by it, so this phase's third key waits for that. Instances (one door, not every
door) need the slot measurement "Identity" asks for. Roughness on a mirror floor and
on water has still not been looked at.

### The glow is a light source

Items 2 and 3 above, built together.

- **An additive glow, the new default** (`0071`, amended again). Row 1's alpha of
  the material table says how an id glows (`SurfaceMaterial.EmissiveAdditive`):
  additive adds RGBC times the glow *after* the texture is modulated, so a dark
  texel lights as much as a bright one; the old mode (`"glowMode": "lit"`) is kept.
  The additive term is fogged on the packet's own depth-cue curve, like everything
  else the game draws: an unfogged glow would pop out of the black at the draw
  window's edge, where the tiles themselves are cut. `PrimFs` splits the curve out of
  `shade8` as `cueWeight()` and adds the fogged glow, `gGlow8`, to the modulated colour
  on every output path (flat, texture, replacement texture, replacement CLUT). Zero
  on every packet without an additive glow, so the other programs are unchanged.
- **A glowing material gives off a light** (`Lights`). When the area applies, every
  tile half with a glowing face gets one point light per material: the glowing
  faces' area-weighted centroid, 192 units out along their summed normal. A face's
  world corners are the half's placement (the tile centre, the floor at `-(h << 7)`)
  plus its mesh vertex (`table + 0xC + header[+0]`, 8 bytes a vertex, indexed by byte
  offset), turned by the record's quarter turn as `func_80014B88` turns the matrix:
  1 is `(z, y, -x)`, 2 `(-x, y, -z)`, 3 `(-z, y, x)`. Its normal is the one the game
  lights it with (`header[+8]`, indexed from the face), turned the same way. A
  glowing model gets a light 384 units above its origin, per draw, from
  `ModelWalk.Scene`. The light's colour is the glow's, times *Glow light*
  (`glowLight`, 0.5 by default); its radius is *Glow reach* (`glowRadius`, 2048;
  0 gives no light).
- **Authored lights win the 16 slots.** Every derived light ranks after every
  authored one, then nearest first. They were placed by hand; a derived light
  comes from any glowing face, however many there are.
- Editor: *Light source* (the mode), *Glow light*, *Glow reach* under each material.
  Shell: `set material:NAME glowMode additive|lit`, `glowLight V`, `glowRadius V`;
  `light list` gives each derived light (`glow`) with its normal and projection,
  and `modelGlow`.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 in `fdat05`, a scratch pack, 144 fps,
render scale 5, 16:9, reflections on, the view pinned with the editor open: camera
`73709,-16448,74986`, pitch 26, yaw 2639, the same view as Phase 2's hash):
- **The formula.** `light_probe.c` gains four passes on a strip textured with a
  known 15-bit texel: no glow, the lit glow, the additive glow, and the additive
  glow untextured. Worst difference from the formula **0** in all ten passes; the
  first six read as before, to the line.
- **Off is the picture it was**: `210d55698c875fb8` with nothing authored, remaster
  on or off, and again after every glow was set back to 0. A zero-glow material that
  keeps its default reflectivity 0.3 is not the baseline with reflections on, which
  is its reflection and not the glow: at reflectivity 0 it is.
- **A wall panel** (`tile:1:37:36:upper`, face 2, colour 1,0.6,0.25, glow 1.5): the
  panel's darkest tenth of pixels had a mean luminance of 54 unglowing, **98 lit**
  and **179 additive**; the median 73, 135, 196. Only the panel's own rectangle
  changed in either mode (12.1% of the picture).
- **Its light** sits at `77376,-17248,74885` with the normal `(-1,0,0)`, towards
  the camera at X 73709, so the lit side is the side the camera can see (it would be
  backface-culled from the other). It projects inside the panel, at depth 2914. At
  glow light 0.5 and reach 2048 it changed 336,078 more pixels outside the panel, by
  up to 29 levels, and **darkened none**. A second face, a wall facing +Z, got a
  normal of `(0,0,1)` with the camera on that side too.
- A glowing model (`model:1:object:486`) got its light (`modelGlow 1`, three sent).
- The saved pack reproduced the same hash after a restart (`d8c08a2ca30faedc`).
- 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s with the panel's glow and light, editor closed;
  `[present] wide 288, plain 0, vram fallback 0`.
- **Cost**: a half is looked at only if something is authored on it, once per apply;
  a model's light is one dictionary lookup per model drawn, only while a model
  material gives light.

**Changed for an existing pack.** A material without `glowMode` is now additive,
so a pack saved in Phase 3 draws its glows differently, and gives off light unless
its reach is set to 0. The Phase 3 hashes above are of the old mode.

**Not judged.** The whole look: whether the additive glow and the spill now read as
a light source, the defaults (glow light 0.5, reach 2048), a model's light at 384
above its origin (a guess at the middle of a figure; a view-space model such as the
arm would get one at a meaningless position), several adjacent halves each giving
a light (they add), and fog on the glow. Bloom is still item 4.

**Looked at: glow.** "It looks pretty good." The same judgement asked for a light
that leaves the texture alone, which the second slice below adds.

**Looked at: roughness.** At 1.0 the reflection on a mirror floor turned into a
fine woven crosshatch rather than a smear; see the second slice.

### Phase 3, the second slice

**What is in.** Everything a material could still say without a texture key:

- **Roughness, without the weave** (`0067`, amended). The blur now reads a half-size
  mip chain of the picture (and of the planar texture) at the level whose texel
  spans the blur, instead of eight sparse taps turned per pixel. Roughness is
  squared before use, so the slider's lower half is the useful range.
- **Metalness** (`0067`): the reflection takes the surface's hue at full value, so a
  dark bronze tints what it reflects without darkening it.
- **Specular** (`0071`, amended): the highlight an authored light, or a glow's own
  light, leaves. Normalised Blinn-Phong, its size from roughness, added past the
  texture, fogged, and tinted by the texel on a metal.
- **Occlusion** (`0067`): how much the occlusion pass darkens a material, applied at
  the present from the surface buffer's id. A glowing material defaults to 0.
- **Light without glow**: `"light"` is the material's own light intensity, in its
  emissive colour, whether or not the surface glows; without it, a material reads as
  it did (`glowLight`, 0.5, times the glow). **A material's light does not light that
  material** (a point's outer cosine carries the id, `0071`), so a lamp with no glow
  keeps its texture exactly and a glowing panel is no longer lit by itself too.
- **Glow ignores fog** (`"glowFog": false`), additive glows only.
- **Pulse**: `pulseAmount`, `pulseHz`, `pulseStyle` breathe or flicker, on the world
  tick (`Lights.Ticks`, now counted whether or not a light is sent), so it holds while
  the world is paused. The glow and its light pulse together.
- Editor: *Metalness*, *Specular*, *Occlusion*, *Fogged*, *Light*, *Light reach*,
  *Pulse*, *Pulse rate*, *Flicker*. Shell: `set material:NAME metalness|specular|
  occlusion|light|pulseAmount|pulseHz V`, `glowFog on|off`, `pulseStyle breathe|flicker`.

**Measured** (area 1, the pinned view, reflections on, a scratch pack):
- **The weave was the roughness blur, not the reflections.** A mirror floor
  (`tile:1:37:36:upper` face 3) at roughness 0, 0.5 and 1, on the previous build and
  this one, each with the pass at 2x and at full resolution; the autocorrelation of
  the reflection's fine detail:

  | build, pass | roughness 0 | 0.5 | 1 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | previous, 2x | no repeat | **every 8 px, +0.50** | **8 px, +0.39** |
  | previous, full | no repeat | **every 4 px, +0.72** | **4 px, +0.68** |
  | this, 2x or full | no repeat | no repeat | no repeat |

  The repeat was the 4x4 pattern at the pass's resolution (render scale 4 there),
  so the resolution set its size and not its existence. The dark band under the ledge
  in the report's shots was not checked; it is in area 0.
- **The formula.** `light_probe.c`: 14 passes, 126 cases, every one 0 from the
  formula; the first ten read as before. The skip pass lights 452 pixels of 512.
- **Off is the picture it was**: `210d55698c875fb8` with nothing authored, and again
  after each new term was set back to 0.
- **Light only** (colour 1,0.7,0.4, light 1.5, reach 3000, no glow, on the wall
  panel): all 309,703 of the panel's pixels unchanged; 601,350 around it lit; none
  darker.
- **Specular 1** on the floor under a light placed to mirror into it: at roughness
  0.5, 66,444 pixels brighter by up to 49; at 0.2, 6,245 by up to 213; none darker.
  On a metal the same pixels take the texel's colour.
- **Metalness 1** on a mirror floor changed its reflection by up to 24 levels.
- **Occlusion 0** on a wall: 210,402 pixels brighter by up to 10, none darker.
- **Pulse** 1 at 2 Hz: three snaps 0.3 s apart with the world running, three hashes;
  with the editor open, the same hash twice.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s with all of it at once (a pulsing glowing panel
  with its light, a rough metal mirror floor with a highlight, a wall at occlusion 0
  and an authored light), editor closed; `[present] wide 288`.

**Changed for an existing pack.** A glowing material is exempt from occlusion unless
it says otherwise, and its light no longer lights itself, so a glowing panel reads a
little dimmer than in the first slice. Roughness is squared, so a saved value blurs
less than it did.

**Not judged.** All of it: whether roughness 0.2-0.5 reads as polished or wet stone
and whether the blur grows with distance as it should, highlights on the floor and
on models, metal on a mirror, a pulse's rate and a flicker's feel, a lamp with no
glow, an unfogged glow at the edge of the draw window. The blur reads the whole
picture, HUD included, at high roughness near it.

**Looked at: metalness is hard to see.** "I'm struggling to see metalness
whatsoever." Three reasons in the design: it only tints the reflection and the
highlight, so with reflectivity 0 (or reflections off) and no highlight it does
nothing; the tint is the surface's hue, and this game's stone is nearly grey
(measured: 24 levels at most); and it leaves out what makes a metal read as one --
a strong reflection looking straight at it (F0 is not raised) and a darker base
colour. **Next** (proposed, not started): metalness pulls F0 up to the reflectivity,
darkens the surface's own colour, and saturates the tint a little; whether it also
brings some reflectivity of its own when that is 0 is the user's call. **Decided (2026-09-26): it does** -- a metal is a mirror tinted
by its colour, so the reflectivity a metal gets is at least its metalness, as in
PBR. Built after Phase 4; see "Metal is a tinted mirror".

### Phase 4: materials by texture

**Rescoped (2026-09-26).** Phase 4 was written for texture packs: replacement
images, then normal and roughness maps that come only with one. Nobody here is
making a pack, so none of that would change a picture anyone looks at. What the
first slice built -- one stable name per piece of art -- is kept, and turned to
what an author of materials wants: **set a material once on a texture, and have it
wherever that art is drawn, in every area.**

- **Ships:**
  - the texture key made stable for materials: the image the game uploaded, its
    pieces joined, and the scrolling textures keyed on their source image;
  - `remaster/textures.json`, game-wide, the least specific rule (a half, a face,
    a mesh and a model all win over it);
  - the editor's pick names the texture under the click, with an *Everywhere*
    material and an *Any palette* choice; `set texture material NAME`;
  - the rule reaching everything that reads a material: the packet (reflections,
    glow, highlight, occlusion), the retained scene, and a glow's lights.
- **Mechanism measured by:** the census of material keys in view, stable across
  ticks while the water scrolls, across areas and across a reload; packets sealed
  by texture; the pinned view's hash with nothing authored; the frame's cost.
- **You look at:** a wet or rough stone set once, in every area it appears.

The replacement work from the first slice stays in, costs nothing without a pack,
and is parked: the water's replacement through `0053`, replacements in the
retained scene, and normal and roughness maps (`0075`) are Phase 8.

### Phase 4, the first slice

**What is in** (`0073`, and `patches/remaster/TextureCensus.cs`):

- **The census.** Every lookup the replacement resolver makes, bucketed by the
  settled area: keys, distinct art, the places (page, CLUT, rectangle) each key was
  seen at, places whose art changes under them, page+CLUT groups whose rectangles
  overlap, GPU-dirty keys, what a pack covers, and what the game uploads at a time.
  `KF2_TEXCENSUS=1` prints a line every 5 s; the `textures [on|off|reset|save]`
  shell verb answers the same, and `save` writes `dump/SLUS-00158/census/area-N.json`
  with each key's file name (`INDEX_CLUT.png`, the name `TextureDumper` writes and
  a pack's `textures/` takes), page, rectangle, hits, covered, dynamic. Hashes and
  rectangles only, so a report may sit beside a pack.
- **Textures were refused as GPU-dirty**, which nothing had said: 74 of area 1's
  86 keys. `GlCore`'s batch bounds were never reset (see `0073` in
  `RECOMPONE_PATCHES.md`), so the game's first untargeted draw at `GAME.EXE`'s
  start -- a 32x32 black box at `(0,344)` -- marked `(0,0)` 748x481 dirty, and
  every texture page under it stayed refused until the game happened to upload it
  again. After: 0 dirty keys.
- **A key per uploaded image.** The key was the polygon's UV bounding box, and this
  game's faces read a texel past their texture: one texture showed as
  `[191,63,65,64]`, `[191,63,64,64]` and more. A rectangle is keyed on the
  LoadImage that last wrote its centre when it lies inside that image to within two
  texels, else on the face's `0060` rectangle, never a fan triangle's own UVs.
  `KF2_TEXKEY=face` and `KF2_TEXKEY=triangle` are the comparisons.
- **A replacement is filtered by the port's slider**: trilinear with the
  anisotropy level while mipmaps are on, bilinear with them off, taken on the
  unwrapped UV's gradients; a replaced CLUT keeps the anisotropic taps.

**Measured.**

- **Keys in area 1** (slot 2, the spawn, 12 s):

  | keying | keys | overlapping pairs | rects inside another |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | triangle (upstream) | 109 | 540 | 59 |
  | face | 86 | 471 | 44 |
  | upload | **21** | **6** | **1** |

  The six left are one sheet at page `0x6` uploaded 128x120 while its faces reach
  row 127, so they fall back to the face's rectangle.
- **What the game uploads**: the map's textures as 128x128 images (read at first as
  sheets of four tiles; see the correction below), models' as 64x64, 32x32 and
  16x16 images. In area 1, six 8-word-wide strips (heights 4-28) go up about five
  times a second each.
- **The water cannot be keyed by content.** In `fdat02` (area 0) the census saw
  1,657 keys in 12 s, 1,631 of them on page `0x15` and 1,538 of those dynamic:
  `func_8002DC78` rewrites the fluid slots in strips every tick, so the upload
  under a face is a strip and its texels change with the phase. The other 26 keys
  of the area are ordinary.
- **A pack reaches the screen.** A scratch pack (`packs/phase4-test`, generated
  test patterns, not committed) replacing area 1's two tile sheets at 512x512:
  `[assets] tile ...: 128x128 -> 512x512 (4x, 4x)`, 2 keys replaced, 97.4% of the
  pinned view's pixels changed, the filter set twice, no GL error under
  `KF2_GLDEBUG=1`. With `KF2_TEXKEY=face` the same pack replaces nothing, since no
  face's rectangle is a sheet.
- **Off is the picture it was**: with no pack, the pinned area-1 view is
  `210d55698c875fb8`, as before, and with the census on.
- **Cost**: frame work 1.10-1.12 ms with the pack against 1.05-1.08 without, at
  144.0 fps drawn and 20.0 ticks/s; the packet walk's self time goes 0.135 to
  0.167 ms, the resolver's lookups. `[present] wide 288`.

**Not judged.** All of it: a replaced sheet under trilinear and anisotropic
filtering at a distance and in motion, and whether the test pattern lies on the
floor the right way up and at the right scale. The pack is kept in
`scratch/phase4-test`; copy it into `packs/` to look with it. **It was first left in
`packs/`, where every pack is enabled by default**, so every boot drew area 1 in the
test pattern until it was moved out.

**Not done**, parked with the rescope (see "Phase 4: materials by texture"): a
replaced water texture scrolled through `0053`; replacements in the retained
scene's world program (`0072`); upstream's 16-bit and page fallbacks, untested
here; normal and roughness maps (`0075`).

**Corrected by the second slice.** The map's 128x128 upload is **one texture**, not
four tiles: a source face's UVs span the whole of it, and the subdivider draws it
as four quarter-quads, which is where the 64x64 rectangles came from. Some uploads
are one image in two pieces (100 rows and 28), which the second slice joins. And
area 1's 8-word strips are a scrolling texture's wrap, drawn in view.

### Phase 4, the second slice

**What is in** (`patches/remaster/TextureKeys.cs`, `0073` amended):

- **A material key per piece of art.** `TextureKeys` names the art a face draws as
  upstream's texture packs would (`TexKey`: the index hash and the hash of the CLUT
  entries it uses), from the image the game uploaded it in
  (`TextureResolver.ToUpload`, now public). Two things the first slice had wrong
  about the art are fixed in `0073`: an image the game loads in pieces straight
  down, at one x and width, is one image (`VramTracker.NoteUpload` extends the
  previous load), and the map's 128x128 image is one texture.
- **The scrolling textures keyed on their source.** Their VRAM is rewritten at a
  new phase every tick, so no hash of it holds. A face whose centre lies in a live
  `func_8002DC78` slot's dest rectangle is keyed on the slot's source image in RAM,
  hashed as `TextureTile.Hash` hashes a rectangle, so it is the key the VRAM would
  have at phase 0 (not checked against a phase-0 upload); the slots are read again
  only when VRAM has been written.
- **`remaster/textures.json`**: `{"index", "clut"?, "material", "note"?}`, in every
  area and with no fingerprint (it names content). Without `"clut"` a rule holds
  for the art in any palette. It is the least specific rule: `SealDepth` asks for
  it only when no half, face, mesh or model rule named the packet, so it reaches
  models as well as the map.
- **Everything that reads a material sees it**: the packet's record (reflections,
  glow, highlight, occlusion), the retained scene's map, and a glow's lights
  (`Lights.TileGlow` asks per mesh face).
- **Editor**: a pick records the texture of the triangle under the click; the
  selection panel shows it with *Any palette* (on by default) and an *Everywhere*
  material. Shell: `select pick` answers `texture` and `textureMaterial`;
  `set texture material NAME|none` sets the picked art, `set texture:INDEX[:CLUT]
  material NAME|none` a key. The census (`textures save`) lists the material keys
  looked up since its last reset (`cells`).

**Measured.**

- **Keys in view.** Area 1 at the spawn, editor open: 7 material keys, none outside
  an upload; before the pieces were joined, three faces on page `0x6` and `0x7` fell
  outside theirs. The replacement census on the same view: **17 keys and no
  overlapping rectangles** (21 and 6 pairs before).
- **Stable across ticks.** `fdat02`'s water (`texture:304d2876ffce31b6`, from the
  source image) given a glow: 68,991-69,399 packets a second sealed with it while
  the world ran and the water scrolled, 0 once the rule was cleared.
- **Stable across areas.** Area 1's main 128x128 texture (`texture:db3893e2e2480ee2`)
  is also drawn in `fdat02` (and is the key the first slice's replacement took). A
  rule set on it in area 0 sealed 144 packets a second there; after `load 2`,
  6,768 a second in area 1, from the same saved `textures.json`.
- **The retained scene**: with reflections and the retained scene on, 4,443
  authored faces in its map from that one rule, and four planes ranked; no GL
  error under `KF2_GLDEBUG=1`.
- **Off is the picture it was**: remaster on with an empty pack, the pinned area-1
  view is `210d55698c875fb8`.
- **Cost**, frame work in area 1 at 144 fps with a material that neither glows nor
  reflects (so only the lookup is paid): 1.15-1.16 ms against 1.06-1.10 with
  nothing authored. The C# assembler's self time goes 0.105 to 0.128 ms. 144.0 fps
  drawn at 20.0 ticks/s.

**A glowing texture gives a light per half.** A glow's light is placed per tile half
and material, as for a mesh rule; a texture on most of an area makes thousands
(2,175 in area 1 from one rule), of which the nearest 16 are sent. Set *Light* to 0
on a material meant to glow without lighting the room.

**Not judged.** All of it: the *Everywhere* combo and *Any palette* in the editor
have been driven only through the shell, and no picture of a texture material has
been looked at.

**Not done.** A texture rule on a model gives no glow light of its own (the model
lights come from model rules); the retained scene's models take only their model
rule.

### Metal is a tinted mirror

**What is in** (`patches/remaster/Surfaces.cs`, `0067` amended), the change decided
under "Looked at: metalness is hard to see":

- **A metal reflects at least its metalness**, and as strongly looking straight at
  it as at a grazing angle: the table gets `max(reflectivity, metalness)` and F0
  pulled that far towards it (`F0 + (R - F0) * metalness`). The pack keeps what the
  author wrote; only the table the passes read changes, so the retained scene ranks
  a metal floor as a plane as it would a reflective one.
- **Its own colour is darker**: half of it comes off at metalness 1, hit or miss,
  and the reflection's weight comes off what is left (`emit()` in `SsrFs`, alpha
  `1 - (1 - dark)(1 - w)`). With no metal the alpha is `w`, as it was.
- **The tint is a little more saturated**: the surface's hue, pushed from its grey
  by half the metalness and put back at full value.
- The highlight's tint is unchanged. All of it needs reflections on: without them a
  metal is the colour it was.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 at the spawn, `KF2_SSR=1`, a scratch pack,
144 fps, the editor open, a 2140x1200 window; `tile:1:37:36:upper` given
reflectivity 0.5, F0 0.1; the view's hashes are this window's, not
`210d55698c875fb8`'s):

- **Off is the picture it was.** The previous build and this one give the same
  hashes with nothing authored (`3c64ce3b3e2bdd2e`) and with the floor at
  metalness 0 (`b9b825b766d81be5`). Metalness 1 and back to 0 returns that hash.
- **Metalness is visible now.** Over the 922,162 pixels it changed, against
  metalness 0:

  | | mean luma | mean saturation | largest change |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | metalness 0 | 100.2 | 0.479 | -- |
  | 1, the previous build | 98.2 | 0.514 | 19 |
  | 0.5 | 70.9 | 0.469 | 94 |
  | 1 | 41.4 | 0.684 | 229 |

  At metalness 1, 902,941 of them got darker and 19,221 brighter: the floor is
  mostly the reflection of a dark room now.
- **The retained scene**: a floor at reflectivity 0 and metalness 1 is ranked as a
  plane (`2 authored face(s)`, a plane at Y -14848); no GL error under
  `KF2_GLDEBUG=1`, 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s.
- **Cost**: a shader-only change, a few ALU ops on reflective pixels; 144.0 fps
  drawn at 20.0 ticks/s with the metal floor in view.

**Not judged.** Whether metalness 1 reads as metal or just as a darker floor;
whether half is the right darkening where the reflection misses; the saturation's
push on this game's near-grey stone.

### Phase 5: atmosphere

- **Ships:**
  - light-record overrides after stage 1's copy;
  - fog colour and curve (`0074`);
  - a sky fill at the far plane that respects `Overlay`, so the HUD is never
    painted over;
  - `atmosphere.json`.
- **Depends on:** the read census confirming that only rendering reads the light
  records. Done: see "The light records are read only by the renderer".
- **Mechanism measured by:** `KF2_PERPIXEL_PROBE=2`, the formula against the GTE's
  colour, still exact with an override on; the SSR fog-curve readback moving
  with the new curve; `snap` for the no-override case.
- **You look at:** the whole area's mood; the sky against the void past the draw
  distance.
- **Done:** the overrides in "Phase 5, the first slice"; the fog colour, the curve
  and the sky in "Phase 5, the second slice". The sky turned out to be the game's
  own background clear, not a fill at the far plane.

### The light records are read only by the renderer

**Confirmed, statically and at run time**, which is what Phase 5's overrides were
waiting on.

**Statically** (`scripts/callgraph.py`'s `Graph.touching`, after the parser was
brought up to the current codegen; see "The static model read nothing" in
`DEVELOPMENT.md`): every function in any overlay that forms an address inside the
destination records (`0x801930EC`-`0x80195170`) or the source
(`0x800679A0`-`0x80068760`). The destination's are stage 1 (`func_8002C944`, the
copy), stage 10 (`func_8002CA74`, which turns each light matrix through its three
quarter-turns with `func_80014B88`), `func_8002CBD4` (the same, inside the NPC
conversation loop `func_80043388`), the tile half `func_80031950`, the HUD
`func_80031D5C`, the arm `func_80032400`, the model submitter `func_80032588` and
`func_80032AC4`, which loads a record's colour matrix and back colour to draw a
model. All of it is lighting. The source's are the area setup `func_80015DD4` and,
in `fdat14` and `fdat20`, the area modules, which write records 63-64 and the load
flag. A table reached through an index the dataflow cannot follow would not show,
so the run-time census is the one that settles it.

**At run time** (`KF2_LIGHTCENSUS=1`, `patches/remaster/LightCensus.cs`): the
runtime's RAM logger stamps each byte a read or write touches, and a pre and post on
each of 24 owners (the thirteen stages, the NPC loop, the two derivations, the area
setup and stage 13's own callees) credits the bytes stamped since the last event to
the innermost owner running. Area 1 from save slot 2, walking, attacking, the menu
opened and closed, then `warp 6` into `fdat20`, 99 s:

| owner | destination | source |
|---|---|---|
| stage 1 | writes all 80 | reads all 80 |
| stage 10 | reads each record's first matrix (+0x00-0x11), writes the other three; reads the load flag | -- |
| tile walk `func_80031C94` | reads the drawn halves' records, +0x00-0x67 | -- |
| model walk `func_800331B4` | reads 0, 15-16, 20, 62, 67, 69, 71 | -- |
| HUD `func_80031D5C` | reads 64, 65, 72 | -- |
| stage 6, in `fdat20` | writes record 63's first matrix, now and then (400 bytes over the run) | -- |
| stage 7, the area loader | -- | writes 62-63 |
| area setup `func_80015DD4` | -- | writes 0-63 |

No other stage, and nothing outside a stage, read either block. **So nothing but
rendering reads a record, and an override cannot change what the game does.**

Two things the census had to get past, both worth knowing before reading the RAM
logger for anything else:
- **The RAM logger masks every address to 2 MB**, and `PrimBuffer` put the
  primitive buffers above 2 MB, so a primitive written at `0x802679A0` is stamped as
  `0x800679A0`. The first run showed the tile walk rewriting the whole source block
  once a tick; it was the packets. The census is run with `KF2_PRIMBUF=1`.
- **The host clears `TrackReads` at every present** from whether its RAM panels are
  open, so the census sets it again at every event.

Stage 6's write into the destination lasts until the next stage 1 copies the
source back over it: a tick at the original rate, one frame at 144. It is listed
in `TODO.md`; nothing has been seen on screen.

### Phase 5, the first slice

**What is in.** Overrides of the area's own light records, written through the
game:

- `patches/remaster/Atmosphere.cs`: a post on stage 1 writes the pack's
  `areas/<n>/atmosphere.json` over the 80 records stage 1 has just copied in. Stage
  10 then turns each light matrix through its quarter-turns, and the tile half, the
  model walk, the HUD and the arm load the result with the game's own
  `SetLightMatrix`, `SetColorMatrix`, `SetBackColor` and `SetFogNear`. So an
  override reaches the GTE, `0048`'s per-pixel records, `EvenFog`'s blend and the
  retained scene without any of them knowing, and is exact whether per-pixel
  lighting is on or off. Turning it off needs no restore: the next stage 1 copies
  the game's records back.
- **An override names the record's own bytes.** Each carries `recordHash`, FNV-1a
  64 over the record's 0x2C source bytes when it was authored; while the game's
  record hashes differently the override is refused and counted. That is the same
  shape as a face list's `meshHash`. Records are per area in the pack, but the data
  is shared: records 15 and 16 hash the same in area 0 and area 1.
- Every part is optional and a missing one is the game's:

  ```json
  // areas/1/atmosphere.json
  { "formatVersion": 1, "area": 1, "fingerprint": "be64c93e02071c09",
    "records": [
      { "record": 15, "recordHash": "486b851794a9bd96",
        "back": [200, 60, 40],
        "lights": [ { "direction": [0, 1, 0] }, null, { "colour": [1.2, 0.7, 0.4] } ],
        "fog": 4000 } ] }
  ```

  `back` is the back colour's three bytes. Light `j` is row `j` of the light matrix
  (the way a face it lights fully faces) and column `j` of the colour matrix, both
  in the GTE's 4.12 units as floats. `fog` is the record's fog word: the fog starts
  at `(fog & 0x7FFF) / 2` view units, bit `0x8000` picks the linear curve, and 32000
  or more draws none (see "Fog changes at a tile edge" in `RENDERING.md`).
- The editor gains an Atmosphere section: the record under the player, or any
  record the area's halves use, with how many halves use it; a checkbox per part
  (back colour, each light's direction and colour, fog) that starts it from the
  game's value; fog as a start distance, *Linear* and *No fog*; *Reset record*. A
  held control is one undo entry.
- Shell: `atmos list` (halves per record, the record under the player, the
  overrides and whether each is current); `atmos show N` (the game's values, the
  override, what is drawn); `atmos set N back R G B | light J direction X Y Z |
  light J colour R G B | fog WORD`; `atmos reset N [back | light J | fog]`.
  `KF2_REMASTER_ATMOS=0` leaves the overrides out, and the probe line gains
  `N of M record override(s) written`.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 at the spawn, a scratch pack, 144 fps, the
editor open and the world paused, 2140x1200):

- **Nothing authored is the picture it was**: `3c64ce3b3e2bdd2e`, the hash the
  previous build gave for the same view under "Metal is a tinted mirror".
- **Record 15 decodes as the GTE was measured**: back 120 (`BK 1920`), light
  columns 0.6499, 0.6499, 0.8125 (`2662, 2662, 3328`), fog word 16000.
- **An override moves the picture and a reset returns it**: back `200 60 40` on
  record 15 (3,813 of the area's halves) changed 97.6% of the pixels, largest step
  80; `atmos reset 15` gave `3c64ce3b3e2bdd2e` again. Fog 4000 changed 97.6%,
  largest step 150. **Fog 24000 changed nothing**, which is itself a measurement:
  every surface in this view is nearer than the game's own 8,000, where its fog
  starts.
- **The lighting formula still holds**: `KF2_PERPIXEL_PROBE=2` with back colour,
  one light's direction, another's colour and the fog word all overridden, 60,480
  corners, **0 off by 2 or more**.
- **A record changed under its override is refused**: with the saved file's
  `recordHash` edited, the watcher reloaded it, `atmos list` read record 15
  `current: false`, the probe `1 of 2 ... 1 refused`, and the view went back to
  `3c64ce3b3e2bdd2e`.
- Under `KF2_TILEWALK=verify KF2_POLYASM=verify KF2_MODELWALK=verify` with two
  overrides written in area 0: 706 reports over 251,497 calls, **0 RAM, register and
  GTE mismatches**.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 19.9-20.8 ticks/s with the world running and two overrides
  written, `[present] wide 288`. The post costs one hash of 44 bytes and at most
  twenty stores per override per frame; not timed on its own.

**A limit, measured.** The editor's pause holds a modal loop by redrawing stage 13
without stage 1, so an edit made while the world is paused inside one (the area's
fade-in, a conversation) is not written until the loop exits: opened during the
fade-in, the probe read 92 stage 1 passes and `0 of 2 written` until the editor
closed. In the main loop, stage 1 runs through the pause and an edit shows at once.
An override already written stays through a modal loop, since nothing there copies
the records back.

**Judged**, from play through the editor: the area's own lights turned to black and
one authored point light added (Phase 2) "looks fantastic". It is the first remaster
look the user has signed off: a dark cave lit only where a light is, the pillar's
far face black and the floor falling off round the light. The picture also shows
what that look asks for next: **nothing casts a shadow** (the pillar leaves none on
the floor behind it), and blacking out an area means editing each record it uses.

**Not judged.** The light directions against their tooltip, fog at other starts
and curves, and the look in any area but the one in the picture.

### The area's darkness

**What is in.** The look the user signed off in Phase 5 was an area with its own
light turned down, lit by an authored light, and getting there meant editing each
record the area uses (area 1 uses nine). The area now has a **Darkness** slider:
0% is the game's light and 100% leaves only authored lights and glows.

```json
{ "record": "all", "darkness": 0.6 }
```

- It scales the back colour and the three light colours of **records 0-63**, every
  record a tile half's `+4 & 0x3F` can name, after the record's own override. The
  HUD's records (64, 65, 72) lie above them, so the HUD keeps its light. Directions
  and fog are left alone.
- **It is a scale, not an edit.** Each stage 1 pass computes it from the game's source
  record (and the record's own override), so it cannot compound, and nothing of the
  game's or of the author's per-record edits is replaced. At 0 the entry is removed
  from the document.
- An earlier version of this wrote black over every used record in one button
  press. It was rejected as destructive: it replaced the values instead of scaling
  them, and gave no way to choose how dark.
- The entry carries no record hash: it is a setting for the area, and the area's
  fingerprint is its gate.
- Editor: the *Darkness* slider at the top of the Atmosphere section, live while
  held and one undo entry on release. A record dimmed by it says so. Shell: `atmos
  darkness [0..1]`; `atmos list` reports it.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 at the spawn, a scratch pack, the editor
open and the world paused, 2140x1200):
- Nothing authored: `210d55698c875fb8`, Phase 2's pinned hash.
- Darkness 0.5: 98.7% of the pixels changed, largest step 70 (half of the 140 that
  black gives). The same hash on four snaps, set twice.
- Darkness 1: `33baaf5f08d7e504`, the same picture to the bit as the nine records'
  back colours and lights overridden to black.
- Back to 0: `210d55698c875fb8` again, and the document's records empty.
- Record 15's back colour overridden to `200 60 40` under darkness 0.5 is drawn
  `100 30 20`.

**Not judged.** Only the black end was ever looked at (Phase 5). Nothing between has
been. **A known gap**: creatures and objects lit by records above 63 (the model walk
reads 67, 69 and 71 in area 1) keep the game's light. Which models those are has not
been looked at.

### Shadows, the first slice

**What is in.** An authored light casts shadows from the area's map (runtime
`0077`):

- **A depth cubemap per light**, up to four, drawn on the GPU from the retained
  map (`0072`) with the light at its centre. The draw goes through the world
  program, so a texel the game draws as a hole (bars, grates) casts none, and it
  draws only the opaque range, so water casts none. Each face holds the distance
  along its axis to the nearest surface, which is what the world program already
  writes as its depth.
- **Drawn again only when the light moves or the map is rebuilt**, from the top of a
  flush, before the batch that samples it, so a light never shows a frame without
  its shadow. Walking and turning draw nothing: measured, 3 s walking forward and 3 s
  back with a shadowed light in view, 0 cubemaps drawn. The static map is built
  for shadows even with reflections off (`RetainedScene.ShadowsWanted`); the models
  and planes stay reflections-only.
- **Sampled in `authored()`**, per light, before the light is added to the lit
  colour: the fragment is moved off its surface by 1.5 texels at its distance, then
  compared five times, each compare the hardware's own 2x2, at fixed offsets **along
  the receiving surface**. An earlier version offset the taps across the cubemap's
  face instead, which made a sloped floor shadow itself: 11.6% of the pixels an
  unoccluded light reached lost up to 10% of it. Along the surface, that is 0.02%.
  The pattern is the same at every pixel, so there is nothing to weave a grid.
- **Slots**: the nearest shadowed authored lights in the frame's list take the four
  slots, and a light keeps its slot while it stays in the list, so its cubemap is
  not redrawn when the order changes. Glow lights cast none.
- A light casts unless its document says `"shadows": false` (the editor's
  *Shadows* checkbox, `light set NAME shadows off`). `KF2_REMASTER_SHADOWS=0` and
  `light shadows off` turn them all off; `light shadows tune BIAS OFFSET SOFT
  [SIZE]` sets the bias (6 world units), the normal offset (1.5 texels), the filter's
  spread (1.25 texels) and the face size (1024) live. `light list` and the probe
  line report cubemaps ready and drawn and the triangles drawn into them.

**Measured.** Headless, `scripts/light_probe.c`: with no light shadowed, the first
fourteen passes read as before; a cubemap holding nothing leaves the lit wall exactly
as the formula has it, and one occluding its left half removes light 0 there and
nowhere right of centre, 0 off in every case (the filter's bands at the occluder's
edge and at the face's edge are not checked). In play, area 1 at the spawn with the
area's own lights black (darkness 1, above), one light at intensity 4 and radius 8000; for each pixel,
the share of that light a shadow removes, `(off - on) / (off - no light)`, over the
pixels the light adds at least 8 levels a channel to:

| light | pixels reached | fully shadowed | untouched | between |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| in the open, near the far left wall | 2,492,066 | 0.0% | 99.98% | 0.02% |
| behind the right-hand wall | 801,316 | 98.9% | 0.2% | 0.9% |
| partly into the right-hand wall | 966,517 | 90.4% | 9.0% | 0.6% |

- A shadow only ever takes light away: no channel of any pixel brighter with
  shadows on, checked on the first open-light pair and the last.
- The fully shadowed regions are solid, 97.0-98.7% of their pixels with all four
  neighbours shadowed too.
- The same with reflections and the retained scene off (`KF2_RETAINED=0
  KF2_SSR=0`): the behind-the-wall light 98.9% fully shadowed, and the open one
  100.0% untouched.
- Toggling shadows returns the same hash; with nothing authored the view is
  `210d55698c875fb8`.
- One cubemap is about 13,000 triangles over its six faces in area 1.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 19.9-20.0 ticks/s with the world running, and uncapped
  715-764 fps with the shadowed light in view against 758-776 without, in the same
  session.
- `KF2_GLDEBUG=1` reported nothing over five runs.

**Limits, by construction.**
- **Only the map casts.** Creatures, objects, doors drawn as models and the player
  cast nothing; they receive. *Since:* creatures and objects cast; see "Shadows,
  the second slice".
- **A light inside geometry** is fully shadowed outside it, which is correct but
  easy to do by accident with *Place on the picture* near a thin wall.
- **Spot lights** use the whole cubemap.

**Not judged.** Nothing here has been looked at. Worth looking at: the shadow's
edge (soft over about two and a half texels, so wider further from the light); the
contact where a wall meets the floor (the offset and bias could lift a shadow off
it); bars and grates; and the pillar in area 1 that cast nothing in the Phase 5
picture.

### Shadows, the second slice

**What is in.** Creatures and objects cast too (`0077`, amended):

- **The frame's models, from the retained scene.** `RetainedModels` already captured
  every model the object walk submits, in world space, for reflections; it now
  captures them whenever a light casts, reflections on or off, and without
  colouring them when only shadows ask. The lights publish which frame's models cast
  (`RemasterUniforms.ShadowFrame`) once the walk has submitted all of them, before
  `DrawOTag`.
- **A second cubemap per light**, used only while a model is in the light's reach:
  the map's cubemap copied face by face (a depth blit), then the casters drawn over
  it through the world program. The map's own cubemap is still drawn only when the
  light or the map changes, so a model costs a copy and a few hundred triangles,
  never the map again. A light with no model in reach samples the map's cubemap as
  before.
- **Drawn again only when the models in reach move**: a hash of the corners of every
  caster triangle whose bounds reach the light's sphere, once a frame. A creature
  idling redraws every frame; a chest, a pillar or a closed door never does.
- **Which models cast.** Opaque faces with every texel. A blended face with the
  texels the GPU draws opaque, those without the semi-transparency bit, through the
  prim shader's existing `uOpaqueDepth = 1`: area 1's creature 129 has every face
  blended and every texel translucent, so it casts nothing, which is what it looks
  like. A door's blended model (`ModelWalk.SolidKind`, the same test the occlusion
  pass takes) casts with every texel (`RetainedScene.FlagSolid`). Effects (sparks,
  flames, `ModelKind.Effect`) cast nothing (`FlagNoShadow`). Billboards and the arm
  were never captured and cast nothing.
- **Placed from the record, not the camera.** The first version's corners moved by a
  unit or two as the camera turned (the camera's rotation is only good to 1/4096),
  so turning in place redrew a cubemap on 357 of about 475 frames with nothing
  moving. The submitter now publishes each model's own rotation and world position,
  and turning redraws nothing. See "Models, every frame" in `docs/RENDERING.md`.
- `KF2_REMASTER_SHADOW_MODELS=0` and `light shadows models off` leave the models out
  (the map still casts); `light list` reports the caster triangles in reach, the
  model redraws and the triangles drawn into them, as does the remaster probe line.

**Measured**, in area 1 with the area's lights black (darkness 1), one light at
intensity 4 and radius 6000, the share each pixel loses as in the first slice
(`(off - on) / (off - no light)` between models casting and not, over the pixels
the light adds at least 8 levels a channel to), each shot twice and a pixel left out
where the two shots differ:

| caster | fully shadowed by it | of those, all four neighbours too | brighter with models on |
|---|---|---|---|
| object 445, the world running | 90,279 | | 0 |
| creature 144, the world paused | 188,141 | 95.7% | 0 |

- Standing still with only objects in reach: 0 redraws in 4-5 s. Turning in place
  (60 turns in 3.4 s): 0. Creature 144 in reach: a redraw every frame it moves (434
  in 3 s at 144 fps), 0 while the world is paused.
- Model corners against the GTE's own screen words (`KF2_RETAINED_PROBE=1`, creatures
  in view): 100.00% within 1 px, worst 2 px.
- The same with reflections and the retained scene off (`KF2_RETAINED=0
  KF2_SSR=0`): the models are captured for the shadows alone, 516 caster triangles
  in reach, and the light redraws as it did with reflections on.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s with the creature redrawn every frame, and
  uncapped (`KF2_FPS=2000`, reflections off, the same view) 275-285 fps with models
  casting, 270-284 without and 267-279 with shadows off: nothing measurable, the
  port being CPU-bound and a redraw being a copy and a few hundred triangles six
  times.
- `KF2_GLDEBUG=1` reported nothing.

**Limits, by construction.**
- **A model the walk does not submit casts nothing**: behind the camera, past the
  draw window, or outside the grid the walk sweeps. A creature standing behind the
  player, lit from in front, throws no shadow into view.
- **The player casts nothing**; there is no player model.
- **A model's shadow is its frame's pose**, drawn with the frame; nothing is
  carried between frames, so it moves exactly as the model does.

**Judged by eye (2026-09-26): good.** The creatures' moving shadows, and a light
behind a door as the door opens, both approved. Not specifically looked at yet:
whether a creature darkens itself where its own limbs face away from the light
(the offset and bias were set against the map's surfaces), and creature 129, which
casts nothing because every texel of it is translucent.

### Phase 5, the second slice

**What is in.** The area's fog takes a colour and a curve, and the frame a sky
(runtime `0074`):

- **The fog's colour is added past the texture.** The game's depth cue darkens the
  lit colour by a weight (0..4096, from the packet's curve) before the texture
  modulates it. Putting a colour into the GTE's far colour would tint that lit
  colour, and a distant wall would come out as its texture times the fog. `shade8`
  darkens exactly as before, then keeps the colour times the same weight, and every
  output path adds it after the texel is modulated: the result is
  `texture × lit × (1 − w) + fog × w`, a mix towards the colour. A texel blended
  additively or subtractively takes none, since fog takes it away rather than to a
  colour; an averaged or opaque one does.
- **The curve bends the game's weight**: raised to a power and capped at a
  maximum, after the packet's own curve, so the glow and a light's highlight fog on
  it too. Power 1 and maximum 1 are the game's. Below 1 the fog thickens close by;
  a maximum below 1 means nothing ever fades out completely.
- **Only a packet with a `0048` record takes it**, so it needs per-pixel lighting and
  Fast geometry, as authored lights do. A face fogged all the way to black used to
  keep no record, since it drew the same either way; while a fog colour or curve is
  set it keeps one (`PolyAssembler.KeepFogged`), because it is now drawn in the
  colour or not all the way. Anything else keeps the game's black.
- **The sky is the game's own background clear.** `PutDrawEnv`'s `isbg` rectangle
  is what the frame is cleared to; a pre on the game's `PutDrawEnv` writes the sky
  into the `DRAWENV` and a post puts the game's colour back, so guest memory holds
  the game's value outside the call. The HUD and everything else draw over the
  clear, so nothing 2D is painted over by construction. It is the fog's colour
  unless the area names one, and only while the area is settled, so a loading
  screen clears to black.
- The reflection pass fogs a reflection towards the same colour on the same curve,
  and a cubemap miss reflects the sky; the retained planes are drawn with it.
- Pack: the area's `"all"` entry gains `fogColour`, `fogPower`, `fogMax` and `sky`:

  ```json
  { "record": "all", "darkness": 0.6, "fogColour": [90, 140, 200], "fogMax": 0.7 }
  ```

- Editor: under *Darkness*, *Fog colour* (a checkbox and a colour), *Fog curve*
  (0.25 to 4, logarithmic), *Fog at most* (0 to 100%) and *Sky* (unticked, the
  fog's colour). Each is one undo entry. Shell: `atmos fog R G B | off`,
  `atmos curve POWER [MAX] | off`, `atmos sky R G B | fog`; `atmos list` reports
  what was drawn, the sky's clears and the fogged batches, as does the probe line.

**Measured** (`KF2_AUTOSTART=2`, area 1 at the spawn, a scratch pack, 144 fps, the
editor open and the world paused, 2140x1200):
- **The shader is the formula.** `scripts/light_probe.c`'s five new passes (the
  switch on at black and the game's curve; a colour untextured and textured; a
  colour and curve; a colour on an additive batch) are all **0** from the formula
  in C, and the sixteen earlier passes read as before.
- **Nothing authored is the picture it was**: `210d55698c875fb8`, Phase 2's pinned
  hash. A fog colour set at the spawn changes nothing, because nothing there is
  fogged: every surface is nearer than area 1's own fog start (8,000), which is
  what the first slice found.
- So record 15's fog was moved to 4000 first (42.3% of the pixels, as black fog):
  `b55f9d7c8d4a4938`. On that, **a black fog colour is the same hash to the bit**,
  with the fully fogged faces now keeping their records. A colour of `90 140 200`
  changed 42.1% of the pixels (largest step 104); the curve `0.5 0.7` over it
  changed 42.3% (largest 45). Removing the curve gave the colour's hash back, the
  colour off gave `b55f9d7c8d4a4938`, and resetting record 15 gave
  `210d55698c875fb8`.
- **With the fog on, the lighting formula still holds against the GTE**:
  `KF2_PERPIXEL_PROBE=2` in area 0 with a colour and a 0.6 cap, 1,905,069 corners
  exact, 24,424 off by 1, **0 off by 2 or more**.
- **The sky clear reaches the screen**: drawn from a camera outside the map
  (`view -200000 -14400 98304 0 yaw 0`, four yaws) with a magenta sky, 94.9% of the
  frame is the sky and the rest is the HUD.
- **From inside, no void showed anywhere it was looked for**: 0 sky pixels at area
  1's spawn facing four ways and in area 0's New Game view, and under 0.01% from
  the air above area 0; 0 still with the fog capped at 60%, and turning the sky from magenta to
  the fog's colour there changed nothing measurable. The game draws geometry out to
  where its own fog is black, so the void past the draw distance is not in these
  views. What paints the dark blue seen above area 0's sea is geometry, not a sky.
- 144.0 fps drawn at 19.9-20.9 ticks/s with the fog on and the world running,
  `[present] wide 289`. Uncapped (`KF2_FPS=2000`, area 0's New Game view): 178-184
  fps with the fog on, 183-190 with it off and 170-184 on again, which is within the
  run's own spread. `KF2_GLDEBUG=1` reported nothing.

**Not judged.** Nothing here has been looked at: the fog's colour on any area, the
curve, how a coloured fog meets the darkness slider's black, and the sky, which no
normal view was found to show. Two limits by construction: a model or tile drawn
without a `0048` record (Fast geometry off, or a routine the C# assemblers do not
cover) keeps the black fog beside the coloured one, and the curve bends only the
packets' own curves, not a record's fog start, which the first slice's per-record
fog word already sets.

### Phase 6: level edits

- **Ships:**
  - `level.json` with tile byte edits, behind the fingerprint gate;
  - the rewrite census, so a door's tiles are flagged;
  - the gameplay-changing label.
- **Depends on:** measuring whether the tile block reaches a save.
- **Mechanism measured by:**
  - `goto` onto an edited height, with `state` reading a floor gap of 0;
  - `press` into an edited wall, with the position not crossing it;
  - the `KF2_MAP_PROBE=1` dump showing the edit;
  - a save made after the edit loading with the pack off and giving the
    original tile.
- **You look at:** whether edited heights meet their neighbours; lighting on the
  edited tiles, which take their light record from `+4`.

### Phase 6, the first slice

**What is in.** `areas/<n>/level.json` and the feature that applies it
(`patches/remaster/Level.cs`), the rewrite census (`TileRewrites.cs`), the save check
(`SaveCheck.cs`), a Level section in the editor, the `level` and `savecheck` shell
verbs, and a switch of its own.

- **The document holds fields, never bytes.** A half's entry names any of six fields
  (`TileField.cs`): `mesh` (`+0`), `height` (`+1`), `collision` (`+2`, the bits
  `0xF8` written where the byte holds them), `shape` (`+3`), `light` (`+4 & 0x3F`) and
  `stopsFlood` (`+4 & 0x80`, a true/false). Each owns only its bits, so no edit can
  write `+2`'s `0x04`, the footprint the game moves, or `+4`'s unexplained `0x40`. The
  values are the author's own; the bytes as the disc holds them stay in the port's
  memory (`Identity.Baseline`, copied from the loader's source buffer with the
  fingerprint) and never reach a file. A field the document does not know is kept.

      { "x": 35, "z": 37, "half": "upper", "height": 118, "stopsFlood": true }

- **An area applies whole or not at all; so does a half.** The level document carries
  its own fingerprint and is refused whole on a mismatch, and also when the load was
  not seen (no baseline, so no way to know what an edit replaces). A half is refused
  whole, with the reason on the probe line, the shell and the editor, when a value is
  out of a field's range, when a mesh or a collision shape is not one the area's own
  block uses (the only bound there is: the mesh table's `+4` is not a count, and a
  shape is a slot in the 0x600-byte block), or when the game has rewritten the half
  (any byte but `+2` differs from the loaded block): **the game's rewrites win**.
- **Every write is held, and put back only if it still reads as written.** A write
  keeps the byte it replaced; turning the edits off, changing the document or a new
  settle puts the owned bits back only where they still read as written, so a door the
  game opened over an edit since stays open (`keptGames` counts those; not exercised,
  since no door was worked over an edit). A write is
  void, and forgotten without writing, once the loader copies a block in
  (`Identity.BlockLoads`), since the block it was made in is gone.
- **The switch.** `KF2_REMASTER_LEVEL=1`, or *Level edits (changes gameplay)* on
  Video ▸ Enhancements ▸ Remaster packs, or *Apply level edits* in the editor; **off by
  default**, and applied only with the remaster on too. A pack with edits is labelled
  with its count and *changes gameplay* on the packs page. The setting is the port's
  gameplay rule in practice: an edit is opt-in twice.

**The tile block never reaches a save.** `func_80023764` writes the card buffer
(`*(u32*)0x8006E98C`, 0x4000 bytes) after `func_80049A88(buf + 0x400)` packs the
state into it. Read off the code, the packer reads the inventory, the character at
`0x80199414`-`0x8019953C`, the area bytes and the per-area state heap at
`0x801B3188` -- which `func_800492B8` fills from the creature, descriptor and object
tables -- and nothing in `0x801C8484`-`0x801D8A84`; the block is also four times the
size of a save. **Measured** with `savecheck`, which runs the packer on the game's own
buffer three times and puts everything back: in area 1, inverting all 64,000 tile
bytes and the 0x600 shape bytes moved **0 of the 15,360 packed bytes**, and the
control, inverting only the player's X, moved **4**. On the load side, `load 2`
advanced `BlockLoads` from 2 to 3: the loader copied the block off the disc again,
and the edits re-applied over it. So a save made with edits on loads with them off as
the disc's tiles. **What a save does carry is the position** (the control is it): a
save made standing on a raised floor keeps the height, not the floor. What the game
does with a position above or below its floor on load is **Open**.

**The rewrite census.** Four times a second the live block is compared with the
loaded one, with the edits' held bits over it and every `+2` left out, and each half
that differs is kept by fingerprint in `dump/SLUS-00158/census/rewrites.json`
(coordinates and offsets, nothing else), so it grows over sessions. Area 1 from slot
2: **100 upper halves**, all within seconds of the settle at the spawn -- 2x2 and 2x3 blocks changing
`+3` and `+4` (an object's collision shape and flood bit written over the tiles it
stands on), some `+0` too; area 0's New Game, 37. `level rewrites` lists them and the
editor flags a selected one.

**Measured, in area 1 from slot 2, at 144.0 fps drawn and 19.9-20.0 ticks/s,
`[present] wide 288`:**
- **An edited floor is the floor.** Lowering the player's own half from 116 to 112
  dropped them to Y -14336, its new floor; `goto` onto (35,37) raised from 116 to 120
  landed at -15360, the new floor (an unedited control at the same spot, -14848).
  Gap 0 each time.
- **An edited wall is a wall.** Walking from (35,37) into (36,36) with Up for 600 ms
  ends at (74916, 75058), inside it. With (36,36) raised to 140 the walk slid along it
  and stopped at z 75777, one unit short of it; with its `shape` 1 changed to 10 (the
  shape of the wall pieces beside it) it stopped at z 75732, 44 units inside its edge.
- **`+2`'s bits did not stop the player.** Each of `0x08`-`0x80` set alone on (36,36)
  held (the game left it) and the same walk ended where the control did. What
  `func_8002C700`'s `& 0xFC` test is for is **Open**; the field is kept, since the
  game reads it.
- **A floor lowered by more than 1024 under a standing player leaves them in the
  air**, standing and unable to walk: drops of 256, 512 and 1024 were followed at
  once, 1536 and 1792 were not. The game's rule, not the edit's; an author lowering
  a floor more than eight steps should not do it under the player.
- Off put every edited byte back to the game's (height 116, light 15, flood 0) and on
  applied them again; a reload re-applied over the fresh block with nothing written
  into it; a hand edit to the file applied on `pack reload`, a `light` of 99 refused
  its half with the reason, and an unknown field survived a save.

**Not judged.** Nothing has been looked at: an edited floor or wall on the picture,
how an edited height meets its neighbours, the lighting on a half given another light
record, a mesh swapped for another, the map panel showing an edit (it reads the live
block, so it should), and the editor's Level section, which has not been opened.

### Phase 7: the editor camera, and sharing

- **Ships:**
  - the free camera: `Stage13.ViewOverride`, with the grid following it;
  - export of the working pack as a zip;
  - a compatibility report per pack: fingerprints matched, keys resolved and
    keys missing, per area.
- **Risk:** the arm and the object walk read the player's position rather than the
  camera. If that shows from far away, the free camera is limited to near the
  player until those two are given the eye. The grid is not a risk any more: it
  follows the eye, measured.
- **You look at:** flying the camera through an area with nothing missing.

### Phase 7, the first slice

**What is in.** The editor's free camera (`patches/remaster/EditorCamera.cs`, a Camera
section in the editor, the `camera` shell verb), the compatibility report
(`Compat.cs`, a Share section, `pack report`) and the export (`Pack.Share.cs`,
`pack export`).

- **The free camera is `Stage13.ViewOverride`, owned by the editor.** *Free camera*
  starts it at the player's eye (`Stage13.Handed`, the camera the main loop handed
  stage 13 last, override or not); hold the right mouse button on the picture to look,
  WASD to fly along the view, Q and E down and up in the world, Shift four times as
  fast, Ctrl a quarter, the wheel for the speed (4096 units a second, two tiles, by
  default). Shift+E does not close the editor while the button is held, since Shift+E
  is also "up, fast". Closing the editor turns it off and the view is the game's again.
  The world is paused while the editor is open, so the player stays where they are.
- **The first-person arm is left out of a frame drawn from it**
  (`Stage13.HideArmOnOverride`, set only by the editor camera). The arm is drawn in
  view space, so from any eye it hangs in front of that eye. The `view` verb's override
  still draws it.
- **The stored angles run the other way from a mouse.** Measured with `camera turn`
  against the axes the view matrix gives: a larger yaw turns the view left and a larger
  pitch tips it down. Pitch is held within 1000 of level, short of straight up or down.

**The Phase 7 risk does not hold: a frame drawn from the free camera does not depend on
where the player is.** Read first, then measured. `func_80032400` (the arm) reads the
player's X and Z only to pick the light record of the player's tile, and draws in view
space; `func_800331B4` (the object walk) reads the player's position only to range an
ambient sound source (kind `0x1F`), and culls by the cull grid, which follows the eye.
Measured in area 1 from slot 2, with the world paused: the same override camera, the
player at the spawn and then moved by `goto` to stand under it, **the presented
picture hashed the same** (`snap hash`) at five cameras -- 10 tiles from the player
and 1.5 tiles away, 1 object in view each; two 3.6 tiles away facing 5 creatures and 4
objects, and 4 creatures and 3 objects; one 8 tiles away with 1 creature, 6 objects and
3 billboards.
While paused, only what the renderer reads directly can differ, and nothing did.
Flying ten tiles changed the cull grid's digest and closing the editor put back the
player's (`0a4cf34bc982d023`, 11 cells drawn); 144.0 fps drawn with the world paused,
20.0 ticks/s once closed, `[present] wide 288`; `KF2_STAGE13=verify` 0 mismatches over
288 calls a report.

**The compatibility report.** A fingerprint is known only by loading the area, so the
port keeps a census of every fingerprint it has settled on as loaded, per disc, in
`dump/SLUS-00158/census/areas.json`, with the last count of what resolved there: the
surfaces applied, dropped for a changed mesh and naming a material the library does
not hold (`Surfaces.NoMaterial`, new); the lights authored; the light-record overrides
written and refused for a changed record; the level edits applied and refused, or
`off`; and any whole-area refusal with its reason. A count is taken a second after the
area settles and every two seconds after, written only when it changes, and tagged
with the pack it was taken with, so another pack's counts are never shown. The census
grows while the remaster is on or the editor is open, which is when the area is
identified at all. For each area the pack holds, the report gives each document's
entries and fingerprint as **matches** (seen on this disc), **differs** (the area was
seen, under another fingerprint: the document is refused whole) or **unseen** (the area
has not been loaded here yet), and the last count. Texture rules are counted apart:
they key on content and carry no fingerprint. Measured on a scratch pack: area 1
matched with one tile naming an unknown material counted, area 0 given a wrong
fingerprint read *differs* with the surfaces' refusal and its reason, and area 7,
never loaded, read *unseen*.

**The export** is the saved pack as a zip in upstream's own zip-pack layout, `pack.json`
at its root, written to `exports/` (gitignored) with the date in its name, or to a path
given to `pack export`. Not to `packs/`, where upstream loads every `*.zip` as a pack of
its own. It is refused while an edit is unsaved, since it holds the saved files, and
leaves out dotfiles. The remaster itself still reads only one directory, the working
pack, so a pack received is unzipped into a directory and pointed at with
`KF2_REMASTER_PACK`; layering packs is still to do.

**Accepted as it stands; the editor's feel is deferred.** The slice was accepted
without a pass over its handling: the mouse look's rate, the flying and the Share
section's layout are the editor's UX, which is to be reworked once the editor is
feature complete rather than section by section.

### Phase 8: later

**Deferred (2026-09-28).** The remaster plan adds no custom meshes and makes no
texture pack, so meshes the author supplies, replacements in the retained scene,
normal and roughness maps (`0075`) and the GPU id buffer (`0076`) wait until one of
those is wanted. What is below is the list as it stands.

- port-drawn props: the area's own object models first (see "Phase 8, the first
  slice"), meshes the author supplies after;
- ~~opt-in object and creature placement~~, dropped (see "Edited with a warning:
  placement of objects and creatures");
- a GPU id buffer (`0076`), if picking is ever too slow;
- texture packs, parked from Phase 4: a replaced water texture scrolled through
  `0053` (done, "Phase 8, the second slice"), replacements in the retained scene,
  normal and roughness maps (`0075`).

### Phase 8, the first slice

**What is in.** Props: `areas/<n>/props.json`, each an object model the area already
has, placed, turned and scaled where the author puts it (`patches/remaster/Props.cs`,
`Pack.Props.cs`), a Props section in the editor and the `prop` shell verb.
`KF2_REMASTER_PROPS=0` leaves them out; they apply with the remaster otherwise.

```json
{ "formatVersion": 1, "area": 1, "fingerprint": "be64c93e02071c09",
  "props": [ { "name": "urn", "model": 443, "position": [74151, -14848, 74298],
               "rotation": [0, 90, 0], "scale": 1.5, "half": "upper" } ] }
```

`model` is the id a pick names (`model:1:object:443`): the object definition index
plus `0x100`, which is what the walk hands the submitter. Position is world units, up
at -Y, the floor of a half at `-(height << 7)`; rotation is degrees about X, Y and Z;
scale is against the model's own and may be one number or three; `half` is the tile
half the prop is lit from and culled with, lower unless it says upper.

**A prop is an object record of the port's own, drawn by the game's code.** Each is
0x44 bytes above 2 MB (`PrimBuffer.PropScratch`, 0x2000 bytes past the wave copy, so
120 fit), copied when the area settles from a live object drawn with the same model,
and then given the prop's position (`+0x14`), rotation (`+0x24`), scale (`+0x2C`,
scaled from the copy's; a zero, which a model the game grows in has, counts as 4096)
and half mask (`+0`: 1 the lower, 2 the upper, read off the table below). The C#
object walk submits them after the game's own objects, through the same code: the
ordinary-object body of `WalkObjects` is now `ModelWalk.Ordinary`, called per record,
and `Props.Walk` calls it once per prop. So a prop is culled by the game's own grid
(`func_80032D78`), skipped while its model is not loaded (`func_80032CD8`), marks its
texture page and CLUT as wanted like any object, is lit from its tile's light record,
and goes through the game's assembler with the port's packet records. Depth, fog,
per-pixel light, occlusion, a material on the model, a glow's light, the planar
walk's replay and the retained scene's shadows all follow from that without a line of
their own; the pointers the submitter is handed stay valid after the walk, since the
record is not in the walk's frame. Nothing but the renderer reads the record: a prop
has no collision, no behaviour, no use handler and never reaches a save. Copying the
record rather than building one means a prop is only ever a model some object of the
area is drawn with; a model no live object uses is refused by name, and retried each
second, so one that appears later (a door opened, a drop) resolves then.

**What a copied record carries, read off area 1's 343 live objects** (`prop objects`
lists them): `+1` the clip byte, `0x80` and up rigid (sub-model in the low bits) and
below it MO-posed from the record's own inline MO state at `+0x34`, so a prop of an
animated object (a chest, a door) holds the pose it was copied in; `+2` the assembler
(`0xFF`, lit, for every object there); `+3` bit 0 forces the assembler by the
visibility answer and bit 1 asks the volume query; the scale at `+0x2C` is 4096 for
1.0. The half mask read 0 (never drawn: markers, model 496), 1, 2 or 3; most of
area 1's floor objects are 2, the upper half.

**Placing.** *Add here* puts a prop on the floor of the player's own half (the
position the game keeps is the feet: `-14848` there, the half's `-(116 << 7)`).
*Place on the picture* takes the nearest surface the frame drew under the click, then
stands the prop on the floor of that half (the picked tile's, or the player's under a
model), and when the surface is more than 256 units off that floor -- a wall -- pulls
it 512 towards the eye first. Picking a prop's triangles selects the prop
(`Faces.Tri.Prop`, from the record the walk submitted), as well as its model, so a
material set on the selection reaches every draw of that model, props included.

**Measured.** Area 1 from slot 2, world paused, the editor open:
- **Nothing authored is the picture before**: `snap hash` read `210d55698c875fb8`,
  the pinned area-1 hash, with the refactored walk; adding a prop changed it, and
  removing every prop put it back to `210d55698c875fb8`.
- **A prop draws where it is put**: an urn (model 443, rigid) on the floor 830 units
  ahead changed 40.5% of the presented picture; `select pick` over a grid of game
  pixels named prop `urn` across its whole lower-screen footprint, and the game's own
  object beside it as `model:1:object:486` as before. A door (386, MO-posed) resolved
  and drew as well. `prop list` read `resolved 2, drawn 2` and the probe `props 1 of 1
  resolved, 1 drawn last walk`.
- **A material follows the model onto its props**: a glowing material on model 443,
  with three props of it in view and none of the area's own, read `3 from model
  glow, 3 sent` on the probe; all three props switched off read `0 from model glow`.
- **The pack round-trips**: `pack save`, `pack reload`, and the prop came back from
  `props.json` as written.
- **The walk is unchanged**: `KF2_MODELWALK=verify`, 24 reports over `open → game →
  fdat02 → fdat05`: 23 read 0 RAM, 0 register and 0 GTE mismatches (288 walks and
  1,152 submits a report in area 1); one read 1 RAM mismatch, in area 0 with no prop,
  4 bytes at `0x80073DF4` -- the ambient sound's key-on in libsnd's voice table that
  "A verify pass replays, it does not re-run" in `PATCHES_AND_MODS.md` records. Props
  stand down under verify, since the recompiled walk draws none (`props refused`).
- **It costs nothing to see**: 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s with the prop in view,
  `[present] wide 288, plain 0, vram fallback 0`.

**A prop reaches the mirror, the retained scene and the shadows** (measured
2026-09-28; the probes now count props: `planar: ... N of them props`,
`retained: ... N of them props ...; shadow casters in reach N`):
- *Retained scene*, area 1 from slot 2, `KF2_RETAINED=1`, two urns (443) placed by
  pick: 576 of 1,152 captured models in two seconds were the props, 2 a frame, and
  0 before they were added and after they were removed.
- *Shadows*: a light put just above them (`light add l1 pick 160 140`) read 306
  caster triangles in reach with the props and 98 once they were removed, and drew
  the model cubemap again on the removal.
- *Planar walk*, `fdat02`'s New Game, `KF2_PLANAR=1 KF2_RETAINED=0` (a saved
  *World reflections* stands it down), two of model 460 over the water: 576
  submits replayed a second, 288 of them props, against 288 and 0 without; the
  mirrored walk 1.26 ms to 1.54 ms with them in view.

**Not judged**: nothing of this has been looked at -- whether
a prop sits on the floor rather than in it or above it (a model's origin need not be
its base), whether its light matches the objects beside it, and how the editor's
placement feels. The editor's handling is deferred with the rest of its UX.

### Phase 8, the second slice

**What is in**: a scrolling texture replaced (`0073` amended; `TextureKeys.ScrollLookup`).
The water in `fdat02`, the main hall's fire and the creatures' scrolling skins are
`func_8002DC78`'s eight slots, which rewrite a dest rectangle in VRAM from a source
image in RAM every tick at a new phase, so a texture pack could never key them: the
first slice's census saw 1,538 dynamic keys on the water's page in 12 s. A face on a
live slot's dest is now keyed on the slot's source image -- the key the materials
already used (`texture:304d2876ffce31b6` for the water) -- and drawn from that
image's replacement over the whole dest, at the phase the frame shows: the slot's
own, less the leftover `FluidSmoothing` publishes, so a replaced texture scrolls
between ticks as the game's own does. `textures dump on` dumps it as its source
image, 64x64 at phase 0, so an author has one image to paint over rather than 64
shifted copies; `textures replace on|off` switches the texture packs for a
comparison. The shell's `textures` answers the scroll lookups, how many were
replaced, and for each live slot its phase against the shift VRAM actually holds.

**Measured** (`fdat02`'s New Game, a pack in `packs/`):
- **The mapping.** For every live slot (five in `fdat02`), VRAM row `d` of the dest
  holds source row `(d - phase) mod h`: at 8 moments over two seconds the shift found
  by comparing every row was the slot's phase, 40 of 40. The shader reads the
  replacement at that row.
- **The dump**: `textures dump on` for 6 s wrote 21 textures, the water once as
  `304d2876ffce31b6_af8f80b2d98f5c2f` (4-bit, 64x64), and none of its shifted phases.
- **It reaches the screen**: a pack with that image stretched in contrast and 4x,
  every lookup on the water replaced (377,623-756,834 over the runs, none missed).
  World paused, packs off against on, the high-passed brightness of the changed
  pixels correlates 0.24-0.26 with the game's water, against 0.11-0.14 for the same
  image shifted by half its height, at three phases each. Weak because the game's
  water is 4-bit and fogged and the two paths filter differently; the mapping check
  above is the exact one.
- **Cost**: uncapped, facing the water, 133-145 fps with the pack against 122-153
  without, inside the spread of each.

**Not done**: `0078`'s ripples do not push a replaced texture (they run on the
game's texel path only); a replaced CLUT on a scrolling texture is not looked up;
upstream's page fallback is skipped for a scrolling face. **Not judged**: a real
replacement water scrolling, at any speed, or the seam where it wraps.

### Dependencies, in one list

- Phase 1 comes before everything.
- Phase 2 needs 1.
- Phase 3 needs 1; it helps 2, since emissive shares the light term.
- Phase 4 needs 3, because maps attach to materials.
- Phase 5 needs 2's uniform block.
- Phase 6 needs 1 and the save measurement.
- Phase 7 needs 1.
- Phase 8 needs 2, 6 and 7.

### Risks, in one list

1. **The texture key is unstable across UV rectangles.** It is measured in
   Phase 4 and normalised through `GteTexRect` or the upload rectangle.
2. **Instance slots may not be stable.** They are measured before any instance
   key is used, and there is a fallback key.
3. **The arm and the object walk from a free eye** read the player's position.
   Measured harmless: the arm uses it only for its light record, and is left out of
   the free camera's frames; the walk only to range an ambient sound. See "Phase 7,
   the first slice".
4. **Shader cost at a high render scale**, since the port is CPU-bound and frame
   rate hides it. GPU timers per feature are the answer.
5. **Save contamination** from placement edits. Gone with the placement edits,
   which were dropped.
6. **An upstream merge that touches `Assets/`.** The remaster depends on
   upstream's pack code, so the next merge (see `RECOMPONE_FORK.md`) has to
   treat `Assets/` as something the port relies on.

## Open decisions

Each has a recommendation. None of them blocks writing Phase 1 except the first
two.

1. **The first target area.** *Recommend `fdat02`*: a fixed spawn, water, and
   SSR and planar numbers already taken there.
2. **Material or light for the first slice.** *Recommend a material*: it needs no
   runtime patch and exercises every layer.
3. **In-game or external editor.** *Recommend in-game*, with hand-editable,
   watched JSON as the external path.
4. **Where packs live.** *Recommend upstream's `packs/`*: a remaster pack is an
   asset pack plus a `remaster/` directory, so replacement textures and the
   remaster ship as one thing.
5. **Forward or deferred authored lights.** *Recommend forward, inside `shade8`*,
   and deferred only for terms that apply to the finished picture.
6. **Whether object and creature edits may reach a save.** *Decided: there are
   none.* Moving the game's own records was dropped (2026-09-28); props are the
   port's own records and never reach a save.
7. **Shadows.** *Decided: shadow cubemaps from the retained map* (`0077`), drawn
   on the GPU only when a light or the map changes, so a CPU-bound port pays
   nothing a frame for them. The tile-grid march this recommended first is not
   needed.
8. **Normal maps only with replacement textures.** *Recommend yes.* A normal map
   drawn over a 64×64 four-bit texture fights it.
9. **Whether a remaster pack may change collision.** *Recommend tile collision
   only, behind a gameplay-changing label.* It keeps the rule against gameplay
   changes a player did not ask for.
10. **The material id budget.** *Recommend 256*: exact in the surface buffer's
    alpha, and allocated by name at load time.
11. **Where the remaster's code lives.** *Recommend `patches/`, not `mods/`*: the
    remaster is something the port offers, and a mod is a package that can be
    absent (see "What belongs in a mod" in `PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`). The *packs*
    are the optional part.
