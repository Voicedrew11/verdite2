# King's Field II — RecompOne port

Static recompilation of **King's Field** (NTSC-U, `SLUS-00158`) using
[RecompOne](https://github.com/BlackLabelHQ/RecompOne) (MIT).

## Which game this is

The series was renumbered for the West, so the name is ambiguous:

| Chronological | Japan | North America |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (1994) | King's Field, SLPS-00017 | *not released* |
| 2nd (1995) | King's Field II, SLPS-00069 | **King's Field, SLUS-00158** |
| 3rd (1996) | King's Field III, SLPS-00377 | King's Field II, SLUS-00255 |

This project targets the **second game**. The disc in use is the North American
release, which is the English localization of the Japanese *King's Field II* —
same game, so the "KFII" project name is accurate even though the disc says
`SLUS-00158`. If you ever swap in the US-boxed "King's Field II" (`SLUS-00255`),
that is a *different game* and every address and function map here is wrong for it.

## Status

Working end to end: the port builds and launches, initialises the GPU, mounts the
disc, executes the recompiled boot stub and transitions into the `open` overlay,
and stays running. **How much actually renders is not yet verified** — that is
the next thing to check.

## Layout

```
config/kf2.json          recompiler config (schema: RecompOne.Recompiler/Config/ConfigLoader.cs)
config/funcmaps/         generated function maps (address/name/size)
patches/                 hand-written C# replacing recompiled functions
scripts/inspect_disc.py  SYSTEM.CNF + ISO9660 listing from a .cue/.bin
scripts/extract_file.py  extract a disc file and dump its PS-X EXE header
disc/                    your own dump (gitignored)
generated/               recompiler output (gitignored, derived from the disc)
tools/RecompOne/         upstream tool checkout (gitignored)
Program.cs               hand-owned entry point
KingsField2Recomp.csproj
```

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10 — `sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-10.0`
- `chdman` for CHD conversion — `sudo dnf install mame-tools`

The runtime pulls Silk.NET, SDL, OpenGL and OpenAL via NuGet, all cross-platform
with no Windows-only P/Invoke. Verified working on Fedora 43 / Wayland / Mesa.

## Disc structure

Converted from CHD with:

```bash
chdman extractcd -i "King's Field (USA).chd" -o KingsField2.cue -ob KingsField2.bin
```

Result is a single MODE2/2352 track. `python3 scripts/inspect_disc.py` gives the
full listing; the part that matters:

| File | Size | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `SLUS_001.58` | 4 KiB | boot stub named by SYSTEM.CNF |
| `OPEN.EXE` | 186 KiB | title / intro |
| `GAME.EXE` | 378 KiB | the main game |
| `END.EXE` | 166 KiB | ending |
| `CD/COM/*.T` | ~40 MiB | data archives (models, textures, audio, text) |
| `OP/*.S` | ~180 MiB | streamed media |

**The boot executable is a 2 KiB loader stub, not the game.** RecompOne
auto-discovers it from SYSTEM.CNF, so left alone it would recompile 2 KiB and
nothing else. The three real executables **all load at `0x80011000`** and are
mutually exclusive — only one is resident at a time. They are therefore declared
as overlays, which is exactly what the overlay system is for.

Header values come from `scripts/extract_file.py <cue> GAME.EXE --header-only`;
`-base` must be the header's text address rather than an assumed `0x80010000`.

`CD/COM/*.T` and `OP/*.S` are data and streamed media, not code, so they stay out
of the overlay list and are read by the runtime through the CD interface.

## Two traps worth knowing

**1. Number bases are inconsistent between the JSON config and the CLI.**

| | `base` | `size` / `skip` / `offset` | `lba` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config/kf2.json` | hex **string** `"0x80011000"` | decimal JSON numbers | decimal |
| `--generate-function-file` | hex | **hex** | decimal |

So the same value is `"skip": 2048` in the config but `-skip 800` on the command
line. `inspect_disc.py` prints both decimal and hex columns for this reason.

**2. Overlay files are read as raw bytes.** `ResolveOverlay` does *not* parse the
PS-X EXE header — it slices the file from `offset + skip`. Every overlay pointing
at a `.EXE` therefore needs `"skip": 2048` to step over the 0x800-byte header.
(The *boot* executable is different: it goes through `Psx/Parser.cs`, which
strips the header itself.)

## Workflow

### 1. Build the recompiler

```bash
dotnet build tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release
```

### 2. Generate function maps

There is no King's Field decompilation producing an ELF + `.map`, so the
`-elf`/`-map` path is unavailable and we use a linear sweep. Upstream is blunt
about the tradeoff — a sweep "can and WILL get some data as code"
(`ConfigLoader.cs`) — so expect to correct these by hand as bad functions surface.

```bash
RC="dotnet run --project tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release --no-build --"

$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file SLUS_001.58 -base 80010000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/main.json
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file OPEN.EXE     -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/open.json
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file GAME.EXE     -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/game.json
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file END.EXE      -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/end.json
```

Current yield: main 9, open 515, game 1103, end 471. The sweep also resolves jump
tables (1937 entries in `game` alone). Every function map entry requires a `size`
or the loader throws (`FunctionMapLoader.cs`).

### 3. Recompile

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release --no-build -- \
  config/kf2.json
```

2099 functions into `generated/` (~163k lines of C#).

### 4. Build and run

```bash
dotnet build KingsField2Recomp.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project KingsField2Recomp.csproj -- disc/KingsField2.cue
```

The runtime needs the cue at play time as well as at recompile time; pass it as
the first argument or the runtime will prompt for a disc.

**csproj gotcha:** the RecompOne checkout is nested inside this project
directory, so the SDK's default item globs would compile RecompOne's own sources
and its `obj/` AssemblyInfo files (CS0579 duplicate-attribute errors). Hence the
`<Compile Remove="tools/**" />`. Conversely, `generated/` and `patches/` need *no*
explicit include — adding one causes NETSDK1022.

## Fixing bad output

When a function misbehaves, turn on `debug`, `addressComments` and
`disasmComments` in the config to annotate the generated C# with source addresses
and disassembly. They inflate the output a lot, so keep them off otherwise.

Two escape hatches, both per-function and both overlay-aware:

- `stubs[]` — replace a function with a no-op. Good for hardware pokes and
  copy-protection paths with no native meaning.
- `patches[]` — point a function at hand-written C#. Takes `function` or
  `address`, a `target`, and `mode` (default `replace`). The `overlay` field
  accepts a single name, a list, or `"*"`. Since `open`/`game`/`end` overlap in
  address space, prefer naming the overlay explicitly over `"*"`.

Hand-written replacements live in `patches/`.

## Next steps

1. Confirm what the `open` overlay actually renders, and whether it reaches the
   title screen and hands off to `game`.
2. Correct linear-sweep damage as it surfaces — misidentified data-as-code is the
   expected failure mode, especially around the jump tables.
3. Work out the `CD/COM/*.T` archive formats when asset work starts.
   [IvanDSM/KingsFieldRE](https://github.com/IvanDSM/KingsFieldRE) has KFModTool
   and format notes covering this game across its regional variants (no symbols,
   `.map` or ELF, so it does not help the function maps).

## Upstream contribution policy

RecompOne's maintainer rejects AI-authored pull requests outright ("AI PRs will
be rejected, no exceptions"). That governs contributions to RecompOne itself; the
tool is MIT and using it here is unaffected. It does mean any fix to the
*recompiler* should go upstream as an issue rather than a PR, unless you write
the patch yourself.
