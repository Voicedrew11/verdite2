# King's Field II — RecompOne port

Static recompilation of **King's Field** (NTSC-U, `SLUS-00158`) using
[RecompOne](https://github.com/BlackLabelHQ/RecompOne) (MIT).

## Which game this is

The series was renumbered for the West, so the name is ambiguous:

| Chronological | Japan | North America |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (1994) | King's Field, SLPS-00017 | *not released* |
| 2nd (1995) | King's Field II, SLPS-00069 | **King's Field, SLUS-00158** |
| 3rd (1996) | King's Field III, SLPS-00377 | King's Field II, SLUS-00255 |

This project targets the **second game**. The disc in use is the North American
release, which is the English localization of the Japanese *King's Field II* —
same game, so the "KFII" project name is accurate even though the disc says
`SLUS-00158`. If you ever swap in the US-boxed "King's Field II" (`SLUS-00255`),
that is a *different game* and every address and function map here is wrong for it.

## Status

Boots, opens a window, and runs `OPEN.EXE` through PSY-Q startup into its main
loop. `libetc` (VSync), `libcd` and `libgpu` are mapped to the runtime's HLE;
the display is configured and enabled.

The viewport is black because the game has not drawn anything yet, not because
drawing is broken. `KF2_LOG=gpu,sdk` shows the full double-buffer setup —

```
[GPU] GP1(00) 0x000000        reset
[GPU] GP1(08) 0x000000
[GPU] GP1(03) 0x000000        display ENABLED
[SDK] PutDrawEnv  clip=(0,0)-640x240   ofs=(0,0)   isbg=1
[SDK] PutDispEnv  disp=(0,240)-640x240
[SDK] PutDrawEnv  clip=(0,240)-640x240 ofs=(0,240) isbg=1
[SDK] PutDispEnv  disp=(0,0)-640x240
```

— two 640×240 buffers, display on, and then **zero `DrawOTag` calls ever**. The
game sets up graphics and goes straight into playing the intro movie, which is
where it stops:

```
[SDK] Cd cmd 0x02 (SetLoc)  04:42:43
[SDK] Cd cmd 0x15 (SeekL)
[SDK] Cd cmd 0x0E (SetMode)
[SDK] Cd cmd 0x1B (ReadS)      <- streaming read starts, and nothing follows
```

No DMA channel 3 transfer ever happens after `CdlReadS`, so no sector is
delivered, `libcdstream`'s ring buffer never fills and the movie never starts.
`OPEN.EXE` is essentially a movie player — it calls `DrawOTag` exactly once in
the whole executable — so nothing will appear on screen until streaming works.
That is the next blocker, and it is a CD/stream problem, not a GPU one.

```

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10 — `sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-10.0`
- `chdman` for CHD conversion — `sudo dnf install mame-tools`

The runtime pulls Silk.NET, SDL, OpenGL and OpenAL via NuGet, all cross-platform
with no Windows-only P/Invoke. Verified working on Fedora 43 / Wayland / Mesa.

## Disc structure

Converted from CHD with:

```bash
chdman extractcd -i "King's Field (USA).chd" -o KingsField2.cue -ob KingsField2.bin
```

Result is a single MODE2/2352 track. `python3 scripts/inspect_disc.py` gives the
full listing; the part that matters:

| File | Size | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `SLUS_001.58` | 4 KiB | boot stub named by SYSTEM.CNF |
| `OPEN.EXE` | 186 KiB | title / intro |
| `GAME.EXE` | 378 KiB | the main game |
| `END.EXE` | 166 KiB | ending |
| `CD/COM/*.T` | ~40 MiB | data archives (models, textures, audio, text) |
| `OP/*.S` | ~180 MiB | streamed media |

**The boot executable is a 2 KiB loader stub, not the game.** RecompOne
auto-discovers it from SYSTEM.CNF, so left alone it would recompile 2 KiB and
nothing else. The three real executables **all load at `0x80011000`** and are
mutually exclusive — only one is resident at a time. They are therefore declared
as overlays, which is exactly what the overlay system is for.

Header values come from `scripts/extract_file.py <cue> GAME.EXE --header-only`;
`-base` must be the header's text address rather than an assumed `0x80010000`.

`CD/COM/*.T` and `OP/*.S` are data and streamed media, not code, so they stay out
of the overlay list and are read by the runtime through the CD interface.

## Two traps worth knowing

**1. Number bases are inconsistent between the JSON config and the CLI.**

| | `base` | `size` / `skip` / `offset` | `lba` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config/kf2.json` | hex **string** `"0x80011000"` | decimal JSON numbers | decimal |
| `--generate-function-file` | hex | **hex** | decimal |

So the same value is `"skip": 2048` in the config but `-skip 800` on the command
line. `inspect_disc.py` prints both decimal and hex columns for this reason.

**2. Overlay files are read as raw bytes.** `ResolveOverlay` does *not* parse the
PS-X EXE header — it slices the file from `offset + skip`. Every overlay pointing
at a `.EXE` therefore needs `"skip": 2048` to step over the 0x800-byte header.
(The *boot* executable is different: it goes through `Psx/Parser.cs`, which
strips the header itself.)

## Workflow

### 1. Set up the tools

```bash
bash scripts/setup_tools.sh
```

Clones RecompOne, applies everything in `patches/recompone/`, and builds the
recompiler. Idempotent, so it is also the way to re-apply local fixes after
pulling upstream.

**`patches/recompone/0001-bios-load-return-1.patch` is required to boot.** The
runtime's BIOS `Load` (A(42h)) returned the header pointer, but the real BIOS
returns 1 on success. King's Field's boot stub compares the result against 1
exactly and retries forever otherwise, so unpatched it spins in the loader
(~12,900 `Load` calls in 30 seconds) and never reaches `Exec`.

The other two are diagnostics and safe to skip: `0002-cdtrace-diagnostic.patch`
names the function behind a CD register access (`KF2_CDTRACE=1`), and
`0003-libgpu-sdk-trace.patch` gives `LibGpu` the `Log.Sdk` tracing the other SDK
libraries already had, plus a `Log.Gpu` line for every GP1 write. GP1 is
display/control only — a handful of writes per mode change — so tracing all of it
is cheap, and it is the only way to see whether the game ever enabled the display.

### 2. Generate function maps

There is no King's Field decompilation producing an ELF + `.map`, so the
`-elf`/`-map` path is unavailable and we use a linear sweep. Upstream is blunt
about the tradeoff — a sweep "can and WILL get some data as code"
(`ConfigLoader.cs`) — so expect to correct these by hand as bad functions surface.

```bash
RC="dotnet run --project tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release --no-build --"

$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file SLUS_001.58 -base 80010000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/main.json
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file OPEN.EXE     -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/open.json
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file GAME.EXE     -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/game.json
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file END.EXE      -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/end.json
```

Current yield: main 9, open 515, game 1103, end 471. The sweep also resolves jump
tables (1937 entries in `game` alone). Every function map entry requires a `size`
or the loader throws (`FunctionMapLoader.cs`).

### 3. Recompile

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release --no-build -- \
  config/kf2.json
```

2099 functions into `generated/` (~163k lines of C#).

### 4. Build and run

```bash
dotnet build KingsField2Recomp.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project KingsField2Recomp.csproj -- disc/KingsField2.cue
```

The runtime needs the cue at play time as well as at recompile time; pass it as
the first argument or the runtime will prompt for a disc.

**csproj gotcha:** the RecompOne checkout is nested inside this project
directory, so the SDK's default item globs would compile RecompOne's own sources
and its `obj/` AssemblyInfo files (CS0579 duplicate-attribute errors). Hence the
`<Compile Remove="tools/**" />`. Conversely, `generated/` and `patches/` need *no*
explicit include — adding one causes NETSDK1022.

## Fixing bad output

When a function misbehaves, turn on `debug`, `addressComments` and
`disasmComments` in the config to annotate the generated C# with source addresses
and disassembly. They inflate the output a lot, so keep them off otherwise.

Two escape hatches, both per-function and both overlay-aware:

- `stubs[]` — replace a function with a no-op. Good for hardware pokes and
  copy-protection paths with no native meaning.
- `patches[]` — point a function at hand-written C#. Takes `function` or
  `address`, a `target`, and `mode` (default `replace`). The `overlay` field
  accepts a single name, a list, or `"*"`. Since `open`/`game`/`end` overlap in
  address space, prefer naming the overlay explicitly over `"*"`.

Hand-written replacements live in `patches/`.

## VSync: found and mapped

| Overlay | `VSync` |
|---|---|
| `open` | `0x8001EB88` |
| `game` | `0x8005FCC8` |
| `end`  | `0x8001B154` |

Found by fingerprinting the function's *contract* rather than its name, since a
linear sweep provides no names. `VSync(mode)` returns a counter when `mode < 0`,
returns early when `mode == 1`, and otherwise waits — which shows up in the
generated C# as a register copied from `A0`, sign-tested, then compared against 1.
Exactly one function per overlay matches, each 79 lines with identical structure:
the same statically linked routine, linked at a different address in each
executable.

**Confirmed, not guessed:** the helper immediately after it counts down and, on
expiry, calls the `printf` thunk with the string at `0x800117B4`, which reads
`VSync: timeout` — PSY-Q's own timeout message.

Mapped via `patches[]` in `config/kf2.json`; the recompiler reports `applied 3
patches` and emits the body as a forwarding call:

```csharp
public static void func_8001EB88(CpuContext c, IMemory m) => RecompOne.Runtime.Sdk.LibEtc.VSync(c, m);
```

Useful technique for the remaining SDK functions: `func_80014C0C` is the `printf`
thunk (BIOS A(3Fh), 69 call sites). Library routines pass diagnostic strings to
it, so following its arguments names the surrounding function for free — that is
how `VSync` was confirmed.

## The overlay delta: identify once, get all three

The three executables are three separate links of the *same* PSY-Q libraries, so
every library routine exists in all three at a different address. They are laid
out at a **constant offset per library**:

| | offset from `open` |
|---|---|
| `game` | `+0x4A7A0` |
| `end` | `-0x22F8` |

for all of `libgpu`. The offset is not the same for every library — `libcd` sits
at `+0x315B0` and `libetc` at `+0x41140` — because each object is linked in a
different place, but *within* one library it is uniform, so one identification
plus one subtraction gives the other two.

`scripts/match_overlays.py` does this mechanically. It matches on a
relocation-insensitive normal form — `j`/`jal` targets, `lui` immediates and the
16-bit displacement of loads, stores and `addiu` masked out, leaving opcodes and
register numbers. Absolute addresses are exactly what differs between the links,
so masking them is the point:

```bash
# where is open's DrawOTag in the other two?
python3 scripts/match_overlays.py disc/KingsField2.cue 0x80016078

# re-derive the whole libgpu map and emit the config patches
python3 scripts/match_overlays.py disc/KingsField2.cue --libgpu
```

Short functions (a 12-instruction table dispatch, say) match in several places;
the tool reports that rather than guessing, and settles them against the delta
the unambiguous rows agree on. Run against the already-known `libcd`/`libetc`
addresses it reproduces every one of them, which is what makes it trustworthy
for the ones that are not known yet.

## libgpu: found and mapped

libgpu is **two layers**, and only the outer one is worth patching.

The public API never touches hardware. It dispatches through a 15-slot driver
table (`0x8003D610` in `open`, reached via a pointer at `0x8003E790`) whose
entries are the routines that do: `_ctl` writes GP1 and shadows the value,
`_cwc` pushes words to GP0, `_dma` programs DMA channel 2 in linked-list mode,
`_otc` uses channel 6, `_load`/`_store` issue GP0 `0xA0`/`0xC0`. Patching a
public function replaces the whole path below it, and the runtime already
emulates every register the driver layer would have written.

This indirection is also why the library is invisible to the obvious searches:
**nothing in the image ever forms a GPU register address**. There are five
`lui …, 0x1F80` instructions in all of `OPEN.EXE` and none of them is the GPU.
The register addresses live in a data table (`0x8003E7A8`: GP0, GP1, D2_MADR,
D2_BCR, D2_CHCR, D6_MADR, D6_BCR, D6_CHCR, DPCR) that the driver layer loads
through. Finding that table by searching the *data* for the dword `0x1F801810`
is what unpicked the whole library, and the same trick found `libcd` earlier.

| function | `open` | `game` | `end` | HLE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ResetGraph` | `0x80015A8C` | `0x8006022C` | `0x80013794` | |

| `ClearOTagR` | `0x80015FBC` | `0x8006075C` | `0x80013CC4` | |
| `DrawPrim` | `0x80015FF4` | `0x80060794` | `0x80013CFC` | |
| `DrawOTag` | `0x80016078` | `0x80060818` | `0x80013D80` | ✔ |
| `PutDrawEnv` | `0x800160D0` | `0x80060870` | `0x80013DD8` | ✔ |
| `GetDrawEnv` | `0x80016190` | `0x80060930` | `0x80013E98` | |
| `PutDispEnv` | `0x800161F0` | `0x80060990` | `0x80013EF8` | ✔ |

Only the four marked `HLE` are patched, because those are the only four
`RecompOne.Runtime.Sdk.LibGpu` implements. The rest run as recompiled MIPS and
work: their register writes are trapped by `PSMemory` and their DMA (channels 2
and 6, including OTC) is emulated.

How each of the four was pinned down:

- **`PutDispEnv`** computes `hStart = scrX*10 + 0x260` and clamps it to
  `[0x1F4, 0xCDA]` — the same two magic numbers as the runtime's own
  `LibGpu.PutDispEnv` (`Math.Clamp(hStart, 500, 3290)`). It finishes with
  `GP1(0x08)` and a 20-byte copy of the DISPENV to the current-env global.
- **`PutDrawEnv`** builds the `DR_ENV` packet at `env+0x1C`, which is precisely
  where that packet sits inside a 92-byte `DRAWENV`; it then sends the packet
  through the driver's `_dma` slot, copies `0x5C` bytes to the current draw env
  and returns its argument. Two independent struct offsets agreeing is what
  makes this one certain rather than plausible.
- **`DrawOTag`** calls the `_dma` slot — the routine that writes `D2_MADR`,
  `D2_BCR = 0` and `D2_CHCR = 0x01000401` — with the ordering table.
- **`DrawSync`** tail-calls the slot that polls `D2_CHCR` and GPUSTAT and, on
  expiry, prints `GPU timeout:QUE=(%2d,%2d),CODE=(%d,%d,%08X)`.

`SetGraphDebug` is confirmed the same way: it is the only caller of
`SetGraphDebug:level:%d,type:%d reverse:%d`, and `DrawPrim` passes the literal
string `"DrawPrim"` as the `%s` of `%s: bad prim:addr=%08X,type=%s,len=%d`.

`GetDrawEnv` and `GetDispEnv` have **zero** call sites in all three overlays, so
the current-env copies that the HLE versions skip are never read back.

Verification is in the log rather than in the reasoning: with the patches in
place `KF2_LOG=gpu,sdk` shows `PutDrawEnv`/`PutDispEnv` reporting a coherent
640×240 double buffer (garbage struct offsets would give nonsense), the
`[DMA] ch2` linked-list transfers disappear (the HLE `DrawOTag` writes GP0
directly instead of programming the DMA controller), and `GP1(03) 0x000000`
confirms the display is switched on.

## The SDK naming problem

`SdkPatches.cs` routes PSY-Q library calls to the runtime's HLE implementations
by matching **exact function names** — `VSync`, `DrawOTag`, `DrawSync`,
`PutDrawEnv`, `PutDispEnv`, `CdInit`, `CdRead`, `PadInitDirect` and so on. A
linear sweep names everything `func_800xxxxx`, so nothing matches and the
recompiler always reports `applied 0 reimplementations`. Every SDK function has
to be mapped **by address** in `patches[]` instead, which is upstream's own
advice for this case: "you need to map each SDK address to its runtime
counterpart yourself, using `patches` with a `replace` that targets the runtime
function."

```json
{ "overlay": "open", "address": "0x80016078",
  "target": "RecompOne.Runtime.Sdk.LibGpu.DrawOTag", "mode": "replace" }
```

Done so far: `libetc` (VSync), `libcd` (CdInit, CdControl/F/B, CdSync, CdRead)
and all four HLE'd `libgpu` entry points, across all three overlays — 33
patches. Still unmapped: `libcdstream` (`StSetRing`, `StGetNext`, …) and
`libpad`.

What worked for identifying them, roughly in order of payoff:

- **The overlay delta.** Identify once, get the other two for free — see above.
  This is worth doing first because it makes every other technique 3× cheaper.
- **Data-side search for hardware addresses.** PSY-Q reaches I/O through pointer
  tables in `.data`, not through literals in code — there are only five
  `lui …, 0x1F80` instructions in all of `OPEN.EXE`. Searching the *data* for a
  register address (`0x1F801810` for the GPU, `0x1F801800` for the CD) finds the
  table, and the functions that load through it are the library.
- **Diagnostic strings.** `func_80014C0C` is the `printf` thunk (BIOS A(3Fh), 69
  call sites) and the PSY-Q libraries are full of `$Id:` tags and error text —
  `VSync: timeout`, `CdInit: Init failed`, `GPU timeout:QUE=…`,
  `SetGraphDebug:level:%d,…`. Following an argument names the caller for free.
- **Struct offsets as evidence.** A function that writes a packet at `env+0x1C`
  and copies `0x5C` bytes is handling a `DRAWENV`; one that clamps to
  `[0x1F4, 0xCDA]` is doing PSY-Q's horizontal-range arithmetic. Two independent
  offsets agreeing is what turns a guess into an identification.
- **PSY-Q signature matching** against the official SDK objects would identify
  everything wholesale (`ghidra_psx_ldr` and FLIRT-style matchers do this) and is
  the only approach that really scales — still worth setting up if the remaining
  libraries fight back.

## Next steps

1. **Make CD streaming deliver sectors.** `CdlReadS` (`0x1B`) is issued and
   nothing follows it — no DMA channel 3 transfer, so `libcdstream`'s ring never
   fills and the intro movie never plays. This is what is holding up the first
   frame; see "Status".
2. Map `libcdstream` (`StSetRing`, `StGetNext`, `StFreeRing`, …) and `libpad`
   the same way as `libgpu`, seeding from `open` and carrying across with
   `scripts/match_overlays.py`.
3. Correct linear-sweep damage as it surfaces. Coverage is only ~56% of `open`
   and ~86% of `game`, so expect more gaps; `scripts/add_call_targets.py`
   re-derives starts from the code and can be re-run at any time.
4. Work out the `CD/COM/*.T` archive formats when asset work starts.
   [IvanDSM/KingsFieldRE](https://github.com/IvanDSM/KingsFieldRE) has KFModTool
   and format notes covering this game across its regional variants (no symbols,
   `.map` or ELF, so it does not help the function maps).

## Upstream contribution policy

RecompOne's maintainer rejects AI-authored pull requests outright ("AI PRs will
be rejected, no exceptions"). That governs contributions to RecompOne itself; the
tool is MIT and using it here is unaffected. It does mean any fix to the
*recompiler* should go upstream as an issue rather than a PR, unless you write
the patch yourself.
