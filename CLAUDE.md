# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A static recompilation of **King's Field (NTSC-U, `SLUS-00158`)** — the North
American release of the Japanese *King's Field II* (`SLPS-00069`) — using
[RecompOne](https://github.com/BlackLabelHQ/RecompOne). The series was renumbered
for the West: the US-boxed "King's Field II" (`SLUS-00255`) is a *different game*
and every address here is wrong for it.

There is no decompilation, no ELF and no `.map`. Function boundaries come from a
linear sweep and PSY-Q library functions are identified by hand, so most work in
this repo is *reverse engineering*, not application coding: find an SDK function's
address in the disc image, map it to the runtime's HLE implementation, re-run the
recompiler, run the game, read the logs.

**`NOTES.md` is the index, and `docs/` is the working log.** `NOTES.md` carries
what the project is and where it stands, plus a map of the documents under
`docs/` and the exact section titles in each. Read the index before starting
anything, then the one or two documents your task touches — they are split by what
you would be doing when you need them:

| file | when |
|---|---|
| `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | build, run, diagnose, measure |
| `docs/ENV_VARS.md` | every `KF2_*` switch, in one list |
| `docs/RECOMPILATION.md` | config, overlays, function maps, SDK addresses |
| `docs/RUNTIME.md` | interrupts, HLE, the `patches/recompone/` stack |
| `docs/RECOMPONE_FORK.md` | the vendored checkout, and merging from upstream |
| `docs/RECOMPONE_PATCHES.md` | every change the port made to RecompOne, `0001`-`0042` |
| `docs/RENDERING.md` | perspective correction, sub-pixel, Z-buffer, dither |
| `docs/WIDESCREEN.md` | aspect ratio, the HUD, the three culls |
| `docs/GAME_INTERNALS.md` | the game's own addresses and routines |
| `docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md` | hooking, settings UI, frame pacing, smoothing, the map |
| `docs/INPUT.md` | pad, sticks, keyboard, mouse, the menu pointer |
| `docs/PACKAGING.md` | the redistributable: the launcher, the first-run build, CI |
| `docs/TODO.md` | next steps and open, undiagnosed questions |

Update the right document when you learn something — that is where findings
belong, not in commit messages, and not in this file. Source comments still say
`See "X" in NOTES.md`, and **the text they name is not in `NOTES.md` any more** —
the titles are unchanged, so the index resolves X to a document, but it is a hop
rather than a direct hit. Grep `docs/` for the title, not `NOTES.md`.

## Build and run

Nothing here builds without the disc (gitignored, `disc/KingsField2.cue`).
`tools/RecompOne` is **vendored** — its sources are tracked here, so a fresh
clone already has it and nothing needs cloning.

```bash
bash scripts/setup_tools.sh          # build the vendored recompiler

# recompile MIPS -> C# into generated/ (~2234 functions, ~182k lines)
dotnet run --project tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release --no-build -- config/kf2.json

dotnet build KingsField2Recomp.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project KingsField2Recomp.csproj -- disc/KingsField2.cue
```

`setup_tools.sh` builds; `--sync-upstream` starts the next three-way merge from
upstream, and `--signatures` fetches the 15.7 MB PSY-Q bank (gitignored, read
only by the standalone `--autoconfigure`). The cue path is needed at *play* time
as well as at recompile time.

There are no tests. Verification is empirical: run the game with log channels on
and check the trace against what the SDK sequence should look like (see the
steady-state `KF2_LOG=sdk` excerpt under "Status" in `NOTES.md`).

**Anything that has to be judged by eye is the user's job, not yours.** Do not
try to capture, screenshot or otherwise scrape the game window — it burns a lot
of context and produces nothing a person could not tell you in one sentence.
Measure what a counter can measure, then say plainly what still needs looking at
and ask. That distinction is already all over `docs/`, which repeatedly
separates "mechanism measured" from "picture never checked"; keep writing it down
that way.

### Diagnostics

The switches used most; the full list is `docs/ENV_VARS.md`, imported here.

@docs/ENV_VARS.md

```bash
KF2_LOG=bios,cd,gpu,dma,sdk,spu,mdec  # or KF2_LOG=all; wired up in Program.cs
KF2_CDTRACE=1                          # stack trace on first CD register access (patch 0002)
KF2_AUTOPAD=8:Start:400,20:Circle:200  # scripted pad input: seconds:button:holdMs
KF2_FPS=120                            # 20 (default), any number, or off
KF2_FPS_PROBE=1                        # a line a second: fps drawn, ticks taken, what each smoother is doing
KF2_TICKRATE=30                        # the world's tick rate (20, and not a setting); a comparison only
KF2_PRESENT_PROBE=1                    # proves frames reach the screen; prints nothing if they do not
KF2_AUTOSTART=2                        # boot straight into save slot 1..3, past the title menus
KF2_AGENT=1                            # [KF2-AGENT] state lines on stdout
KF2_SHELL=1                            # TCP 127.0.0.1:27900 command channel
KF2_BOOTEXE=end                        # boot straight into OPEN.EXE, GAME.EXE or END.EXE
```

Prefer the mods under `mods/` (**enable them in the game's Mods panel** — mods
default to off and load silently when disabled) to `KF2_LOG=sdk`, which is
gigabytes a minute. `KF2_LOG=bios` is very expensive during play — the game polls
`PAD_dr` hundreds of thousands of times a second.

`Program.cs` is hand-owned (RecompOne would otherwise generate one into
`generated/`); add new env-var-driven diagnostics there, and add them to
`docs/ENV_VARS.md`. The docs mention `KF2_TRACECALL` — that was an ad-hoc local
edit to the dispatcher and is *not* in any committed patch; re-add it by hand if
you need indirect-call tracing.

**For a hang, take the managed stack of the live process instead of adding
logging.** Recompiled functions carry their MIPS address in their name, so the
trace names the routine directly:

```bash
~/.dotnet/tools/dotnet-stack report -p $(pgrep -f net10.0/KingsField2)
```

Start the game from the same shell you run that in, or the diagnostic socket in
`TMPDIR` will not be found.

### Driving the game without a human

- **The attract demo is a free live session**: leave the port at the title and it
  walks itself into an area about a minute later, with a character, an HP bar and
  (eventually) a death. `AutoReload.Simulate()` kills on demand from there, and the
  death clock at `0x8019951A` can be pinned to hold any frame of the death sequence.
- **`KF2_AUTOSTART=<1..3>`** — an agent left at the title waits forever (the boot
  menus take no input by the usual routes, and `KF2_AUTOPAD` only arms once an area
  has loaded). This drives the pad through `PAD_dr`: Start, Cross into a New Game
  in `fdat02`, then loads the slot over it through `AutoReload.LoadSlot`.
- **`KF2_AGENT=1`** prints `{"overlay":…,"inGame":…,"hp":…,"area":…,"slot":…}` on
  each overlay change and about once a second; `inGame:false` is how a program
  tells "stuck at the title" from "in an area" without a screenshot.
- **`KF2_SHELL=1`** — one request per line on TCP 127.0.0.1:27900, one
  single-line JSON response back: `state`, `nearby`, `load <slot>`,
  `warp <area>`, `press <button> [ms]`, `kill`, `ending [boss|kill]`,
  `map [on|off|toggle]`. The `kf2` MCP server in `mcp/` exposes the same channel.
  `ending kill` is the form that reproduces the final-boss crash; reaching it
  needs `KF2_DEBUG_GODMODE=1`, or `warp 7` kills the player on the way in.
  `press` reaches Cross but not the in-game menu's Up/Down.
- **`KF2_AUTOPAD`**'s clock starts when the first area module loads, the only
  point in the boot sequence that reliably means "in game".

See "Auto start and the agent beacon" and "The command channel" in
`docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`.

## The port's own patches

Everything under `patches/*.cs` attaches at run time through `HookManager`; each
has a write-up, and the specifics (addresses, measurements, why each default is
what it is) live there, not here.

| patch | what | default | doc, section |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FramePacing` | skips the game's frame gate `func_80017880`, paces frames itself, runs the gated stages on a 20 Hz world clock | 20 fps drawn, 20 ticks/s | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "Any frame rate" |
| `FrameSmoothing`, `ObjectSmoothing`, `AnimSmoothing` | carry the camera, the four world tables and MO pose between ticks | off; one checkbox | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "One switch for all of the smoothing" |
| `LoopPacing` | modal loops (fades, cutscenes, item/spell animations) run once per tick, gaps filled with stage-13 redraws | on | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "Loops that render their own frames" |

| `SpriteAnim` | billboard cel animation held to the tick | on | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "The flames run at the render rate" |
| `FullRateLogic` | `KF2_FPS_LOGIC=full`; comparison only, **not shippable** | off | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "Any frame rate" |
| `FrameProfiler` | per-frame time by section: every hook, the present path, the waits (`0045`); Shift+P | records while its panel is open | DEVELOPMENT, "Profiling a frame" |
| `Perspective` | perspective-correct textures (`0009`, `0012`) | on | RENDERING, "Perspective correction" |
| `Subpixel` | sub-pixel vertex positions (`0010`) | off | RENDERING, "Sub-pixel vertex positioning" |
| `ZBuffer` | per-pixel occlusion from recovered depth (`0014`, `0036`); no window control | off | RENDERING, "Z-buffer" |
| `Pgxp` | upstream's PGXP as the vertex source (`0034`-`0036`); env only | off | RENDERING, "PGXP has no control in the window" |
| `AmbientOcclusion` | SSAO from painter's-order depth (`0040`) | off | RENDERING, "Ambient occlusion" |
| `Anisotropic` | post-CLUT footprint supersampling (`0041`) | off | RENDERING, "Anisotropic filtering" |
| `NoDither`, `TrueColor` | one *Shading* combo: Dither / None / Smooth (24-bit, `0021`) | None | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "Two shading checkboxes were one question asked twice" |
| `Widescreen`, `CullCone` | aspect ratio; widened view cone and screen tints follow it | 4:3 | WIDESCREEN, "Widescreen", "The cull the margin runs into" |
| `AutoReload` | reload the last save on death, fixed 2 s delay | on | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "Auto reload" |
| `Map*` | full-screen map (touchpad / `M`), minimap (`N`), fog of war, markers; full map pauses the world | map on; fog, minimap, markers off | PATCHES_AND_MODS, "A dynamic map", "What the Map page is down to" |
| `Analog` | twin-stick control | on | INPUT, "Analog twin-stick control" |
| `Mouse` | mouse look, spent inside `Analog.BeforeLook` | off | INPUT, "Mouse look" |
| `MenuMouse` | point-and-click in the in-game menus | on | INPUT, "The menu pointer" |
| `KeyLayout` | the port's WASD layout | on | INPUT, "The keyboard layout" |
| `EndingHold`, `BootExe` | hold "The End", any button returns to the title | on | RUNTIME, "The ending screen" |
| `HitGuard` | fences the final-boss hit-path fault | on | TODO, "The crash on the final boss's last hit" |

Features ship **off** when the mechanism is measured but the picture has never been
judged by eye; say which of the two a change has when you write it up.

### Rules that bite when you change a patch

- **Attach through `patches/HookAttach.cs`, and read back what committed.**
  `AddPre`/`AddPost` only queue a delegate; the detour is made later in
  `HookManager.Commit`, which fails per function without throwing (`0027`), so
  counting `Add*` returns claims what was *queued*. Use `HookManager.IsCommitted`
  (`0028`), retry until it holds, and never latch `attached = true` before
  `Attach()` — an exception thrown inside an `OverlayLoadedEvent` listener is
  swallowed by `Event.Dispatch` into one stderr line. See "A registration is not
  a hook" in `docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`.
- **The frame boundary is a single point of failure and it fails open.** It is a
  `DrawOTag` that follows a `VSync` call; `_tickThisFrame` starts `true`, so a lost
  boundary uncaps the picture *and* runs the whole world at the render rate,
  silently. The stage gate's 500 ms watchdog (`FallbackTick`) is what saves it; a
  hold keyed on the frame (like `SpriteAnim`) fails *closed* and needs the same
  watchdog. Check any pacing change with `KF2_FPS=144 KF2_FPS_PROBE=1`: 144.0 fps
  drawn at 20.0 ticks/s.
- **A gated stage must not draw** (`scripts/check_gate.py`; its `KNOWN` holds the
  two recorded exceptions). Something stepped inside a drawing function's own body
  cannot be gated and needs a hold/restore pair instead.
- **A tick is a frame identity, not a flag**: use `FramePacing.FirstWalkOfTick`,
  not `TickedThisFrame`, when something must happen once per tick inside stage 13.
- **`Widescreen` owns the one `Replace` of `DrawOTag`**, so every other `DrawOTag`
  hook must be a pre or a post, and a replacement must pass the source address to
  `WriteGp0` or perspective correction silently turns off.
- **`LoopPacing` is installed last in `Program.cs`** — its post on stage 13 must run
  after the smoothers'.
- **A liveness test is the renderer's, not the owning stage's**: an object is drawn
  when `u16[+0x6] != 0xFF`, a creature when `u8[+0x9] == 1`.
- **Settings**: a page registers against a runtime section with
  `PatchSettings.Register("display", ...)` (or `RegisterSlot`, `0013`); pages
  sharing a `Title` share a heading and need adjacent `IPatchPage.Order`s or the
  heading is drawn twice. `Extend` has **no un-extend**, so nothing may register
  against `"input"` — `patches/settings/InputSection.cs` owns that pane outright
  and `Register` refuses the id. `gameplay` is the port's own section
  (`GameplaySection.cs`); **a new localisation key must supply all three of the
  runtime's languages** (en, pt-BR, es-419), and **a new sidebar entry must not
  collide with an existing one in any of them** (`Controles` already exists in two).
  See "Patch settings" in `docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md` and "The Input pane is the
  port's" in `docs/INPUT.md`.
- **A control that stops being a setting stops reading its saved key**, so nobody
  is stranded by a value with no control to show it; the env var is the
  comparison.
- **Changing the shipped keyboard layout** means bumping `KeyLayout.Version` and
  recording the old layout in `Superseded`, or an existing config reads as
  customised and is never corrected.
- **Anything the runtime refreshes only at `VSync` is invisible to a game that
  stops calling `VSync`**, and **a handler that never runs loses only the work
  inside it** — both failure modes are silent. See "Two general shapes worth
  keeping" in `docs/RUNTIME.md`.

### Regenerating function maps

Only needed if the sweep is wrong or a new executable is added:

```bash
RC="dotnet run --project tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Recompiler -c Release --no-build --"
$RC --generate-function-file -linear-sweep -disc disc/KingsField2.cue \
    -file OPEN.EXE -base 80011000 -skip 800 -out config/funcmaps/open.json
```

An `unmapped call: 0x…` has three causes, so check which it is before reaching
for a script. **Is the address a function start the map is missing, an address
inside a function that already exists, or a few instructions past a mapped start
that has no prologue?**

- Missing start — `scripts/add_call_targets.py` recovers it by harvesting `jal`
  targets and splicing them into the map. Only sites already inside a known
  function are harvested; a `.data` word that decodes as `jal` is not a call.
- Interior address — the sweep split one real function in two, because it ends a
  function at any `jr`/`j` plus delay slot and PSY-Q emits both *inside* a
  function (a `jr` through a switch table, a `j` to a shared epilogue). A
  conditional branch that crosses a boundary proves it, since MIPS branches never
  leave their function. `scripts/merge_branch_spans.py` merges on that proof (and
  on jump-table entries), checks nothing `jal`s a start it swallowed, and is
  idempotent — run it after any sweep. See "The sweep splits a switch" in
  `docs/RECOMPILATION.md`.
- False split from data — `add_call_targets.py` once treated a table word as
  `jal` and cut a real function. The crash address sits just past a mapped start
  that has no prologue and that nothing in code `jal`s; the previous function
  falls through into it. `merge_branch_spans.py` cannot see a fallthrough, so
  rejoin by hand (the previous start's size should reach the next real function).
  See "add_call_targets can split a function" in `docs/RECOMPILATION.md`. The script no longer
  harvests sites outside a known function, so re-running it will not re-cut.

```bash
python3 scripts/merge_branch_spans.py --dry-run   # all overlays, writes nothing
python3 scripts/merge_branch_spans.py fdat17
```

The FDAT overlays deliberately use `"skip": 0` so the overlay covers the module
header: the modules' switch jump tables live in it, past the 32 dispatch slots,
and the recompiler reads a jump table out of the overlay's own bytes. Raising
`skip` past them makes every `jr` through a table dispatch to nothing at run time.

                         match found into config/funcmaps/, refusing the ones
                         SdkPatches would bind -- see "Merging the SDK names" in
                         docs/RECOMPILATION.md),
                         shader_probe.c (run a real prim fragment shader
                         headless over a known texture and read the pixels back:
                         the only thing here that can say a shader change moved a
                         pixel, since the port is CPU-bound and frame rate cannot),

                         the fix work), check_gate (does the gate obey its rule).
                         kf2run/callgraph/kf2model are their shared halves.
                         See "Finding the rate defects" in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
Program.cs               hand-owned entry point; calls Entry.Run(PSMemory, cuePath)
```

The disc holds a 4 KiB boot stub (`SLUS_001.58`, named by SYSTEM.CNF) plus three
real executables — `OPEN.EXE` (title/intro), `GAME.EXE`, `END.EXE` — which **all
load at `0x80011000`** and are mutually exclusive. They are declared as
**overlays** in `config/kf2.json`. Left alone the recompiler would only find the
2 KiB stub. Per-area logic is more MIPS loaded at run time: the `fdat` modules.

Because the three overlays share an address range, *every* address-based config
entry must name its overlay explicitly. Prefer a named overlay over `"*"`.

### The core problem: SDK functions must be mapped by address

The recompiler's `SdkPatches.cs` binds PSY-Q calls to the runtime's HLE by exact
**function name**. A linear sweep names everything `func_800xxxxx`, so it always
reports `applied 0 reimplementations`. Every SDK entry point therefore has to be
mapped by address in `patches[]`:

```json
{ "overlay": "open", "address": "0x80016078",
  "target": "RecompOne.Runtime.Sdk.LibGpu.DrawOTag", "mode": "replace" }
```

63 such patches exist today (`libetc`, `libcd`, four `libgpu` entry points, six
`libcdstream`, libapi's `DMACallback`). `libpad` is the notable gap — and a
signature match confirms it is not a gap at all: the game links no `libpad`, which
is consistent with it reading `PAD_dr` through `BiosB` instead.

**997 non-binding functions now carry their real PSY-Q names** (`rsin`, `rcos`,
`SsSetMVol`, `RotTransPers`...), from upstream's signature bank via
`scripts/merge_sdk_names.py`. That is legibility only: the script **refuses every
name `SdkPatches` binds**, reading that list out of the patched checkout rather
than copying it, so all 63 entries above still do the binding and the recompiler
still reports `applied 63 patches, 0 reimplementations`. See "Merging the SDK
names" in `docs/RECOMPILATION.md`. Only map a function the runtime actually
implements — check `tools/RecompOne/RecompOne.Runtime/sdk/Lib*.cs` first; unmapped
library routines run fine as recompiled MIPS because `PSMemory` traps their
register writes.

`mode` is `"replace"`, `"pre"` or `"post"`. **Use config patches for `replace`
only** — binding an SDK entry point, which has to happen before any mod could
load. For anything else, do not add a config entry: RecompOne's `HookManager`
detours a recompiled function by address at run time, so a hook needs neither a
config entry nor a recompile. See "Mods" in `docs/PATCHES_AND_MODS.md`; `patches/FramePacing.cs`
is the in-project example and `mods/` holds the loadable ones.

**Generated code is one class per overlay** — `Recompiled.KingsField2_game`,
`_open`, `_end`, `_fdat`, `_main` — because CoreCLR caps a class at 65535 methods.
Code that calls a recompiled function directly carries a one-line
`using KingsField2 = Recompiled.KingsField2_game;` alias (sixteen call sites, in
`patches/AreaWarp.cs`, `AutoReload.cs`, `CullGrid.cs`, `MenuMouse.cs` and
`mods/kf2debug/Noclip.cs`, `Attributes.cs`), so do not also name a namespace
`KingsField2`. A direct call is *not* the same call as `Dispatcher.Call`, which
goes through `HookManager`.

### Identifying an address: the techniques that work

In rough order of payoff (full reasoning and worked examples in
`docs/RECOMPILATION.md`):

1. **The overlay delta.** The three executables are three links of the same
   libraries, laid out at a constant offset *per translation unit* (not per
   library — `libcd`'s `cdio` and `stream` differ from each other). Identify once,
   derive the other two. `scripts/match_overlays.py` does this mechanically
   against a relocation-insensitive normal form; validate any new delta by
   re-deriving already-known addresses with it.
2. **Data-side search for hardware addresses.** PSY-Q reaches I/O through pointer
   tables in `.data`, never through literals in code — there are five
   `lui …, 0x1F80` instructions in all of `OPEN.EXE` and none is the GPU. Search
   the *data* for `0x1F801810` (GPU) or `0x1F801800` (CD) to find the table; the
   functions loading through it are the library.
3. **Diagnostic strings.** `func_80014C0C` is the `printf` thunk (BIOS A(3Fh), 69
   call sites). PSY-Q error text (`VSync: timeout`, `CdInit: Init failed`,
   `GPU timeout:QUE=…`) names the calling function for free.
4. **Struct offsets as evidence.** Two independent offsets agreeing (a `DR_ENV`
   packet at `env+0x1C` *and* a `0x5C`-byte copy) turns a guess into an ID.
5. **Indirect-call tracing.** Public entry points can have zero `jal` references
   because PSY-Q dispatches through driver tables filled in at init (`libgpu`'s
   15-slot table, libapi's `DMACallback`). Log the address in `Dispatcher.Call`
   rather than searching statically.

### Two traps

**Number bases differ between the config and the CLI.** In `config/kf2.json`,
`base` is a hex *string* while `size`/`skip`/`offset`/`lba` are decimal numbers;
on the `--generate-function-file` CLI, `-size`/`-skip`/`-offset` are hex.
`"skip": 2048` in the config is `-skip 800` on the command line.

**Overlays are read as raw bytes.** `ResolveOverlay` does not parse the PS-X EXE
header, so every `.EXE` overlay needs `"skip": 2048` to step past the 0x800-byte
header, and `base` must be the header's real text address (read it with
`scripts/extract_file.py --header-only`). The *boot* executable is different — it
goes through `Psx/Parser.cs`, which strips the header itself.

### csproj

`generated/` and `patches/` are picked up by the SDK's default globs — adding an
explicit `Compile Include` causes NETSDK1022. `tools/**` must stay explicitly
removed, or the build compiles RecompOne's own sources and its `obj/`
AssemblyInfo files (CS0579); `mods/**`, `mcp/**` and `Verdite2.Launcher/` are
removed for the same reason.

## The RecompOne checkout

**`tools/RecompOne/` is vendored: an edit inside it is a change to this
repository like any other.** `patches/recompone/*.patch` are kept as the record of
what the port changed and why, and the numbers (`0001`-`0042`) are how the source
refers to each change, but they are **no longer replayed**. The merge base is
`tools/RecompOne/UPSTREAM` (currently `d81dec8`); the fork's history is the
gitignored `tools/RecompOne.git/`, reached with
`git --git-dir=tools/RecompOne.git --work-tree=tools/RecompOne <cmd>`.

- **Three changes force a recompile**: `0004`, `0035` and `0037`. Everything else
  is runtime-only.
- **The acceptance test for a merge** is `open → game → fdat02 → fdat05`, slot 2
  restored at hp 46/86 in area 1, 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s, every hook
  attached — **paired with `KF2_PRESENT_PROBE=1`**, because every number in that
  run was once still true with a completely black window. The last merge also
  silently broke the vertex map (`KF2_PERSPECTIVE_PROBE=1` reading `0 caught/s`)
  and the widescreen margin's clear; check both.

**Nothing goes upstream. Not a pull request, and not an issue either.** Upstream
rejects AI-authored pull requests outright, and this project does not file
issues against it: a defect found here is recorded in `docs/` and fixed in the
vendored tree, which is the whole point of vendoring it. If the user wants
something reported upstream they will write it themselves.

## Shipping it

**The port cannot ship a playable binary.** `generated/` is a translation of
FromSoftware's code, so the assembly that plays the game has to be built on the
machine of somebody who owns the disc. The release ships every **input** —
`config/`, `patches/**`, `Program.cs`, the vendored RecompOne — and makes the
output at first run. That is also a correctness win: the generated dispatch tables
bake **absolute LBAs from one mastering**, so a prebuilt binary would silently
fail to load area modules on a differently mastered dump.

- **`Verdite2.Launcher/` is the shipped executable and compiles neither
  `generated/` nor `patches/`** — it carries them as payload under `content/` and
  compiles them at first run. Anything added there must keep that property;
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` asserts it on every push, because it is invisible
  locally where `generated/` exists.
- **The recompiled output and the port's sources compile in ONE Roslyn pass**
  (`GameCompile`). Its reference set comes from `TRUSTED_PLATFORM_ASSEMBLIES`, not
  loaded assemblies, and it supplies `GlobalUsings.g.cs` itself, since
  `ImplicitUsings` is an SDK feature.
- **`GameCompile`'s options and `KingsField2Recomp.csproj`'s properties are two
  statements of one thing and must stay in step** — a difference is a bug that
  exists only in the release. Check the packaged binary with
  `KF2_FPS=144 KF2_FPS_PROBE=1`: 144.0 fps drawn at 20.0 ticks/s.
- **The version is one line in `VERSION`**; everything else reads it, and
  `release.yml` asserts the tag equals `v$(cat VERSION)`. `bash scripts/release.sh
  0.2.0` bumps, commits and tags, and deliberately does not push.
- Packaging is `packaging/linux/build-appimage.sh` and
  `packaging/windows/build-windows.ps1`, neither of which needs the disc.
  **Trimming is off and must stay off** (MonoMod detours, Roslyn, `AutoStart`'s
  reflection).
- **QuickJit is off and must stay off, in both `KingsField2Recomp.csproj` and
  `Verdite2.Launcher.csproj`** (`TieredCompilationQuickJit`). Tier-up recompiles a
  hooked method and MonoMod's detour does not reliably follow, so a committed hook
  stops firing for the session with `IsCommitted` still true — that was the boot
  that ran at twice the chosen rate. `FramePacing`'s sentinel prints
  `[KF2] pacing sentinel:` if a pacing hook is ever lost again. `DiscCheck.Validate` fills `Runtime.DiscValidator` and refuses
  `SLUS-00255` by name.

See `docs/PACKAGING.md`.

## Repository conventions

Never commit disc data or recompiler output — `disc/`, `generated/`, `*.sav` and
`settings.json` (written by the runtime at play time) are gitignored for
copyright and cleanliness reasons.

Commit messages in this repo state the *finding*, in the imperative, with the
observable consequence: "Map the PSY-Q CD library; boot now reaches the main
loop".
