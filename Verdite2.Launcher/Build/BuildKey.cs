/// <summary>
/// What identifies one built game assembly, so a second launch can skip the build
/// and a changed input cannot be served a stale one.
///
/// Three things go in, and each answers a way the cached assembly could be wrong:
///
///   - The disc's own code. Not the file's hash: an image can differ in padding,
///     track layout or the 180 MB of streamed media and still produce byte-identical
///     output. What the recompiler reads is the three executables and the nine
///     FDAT.T slices, so those are what is hashed -- two dumps that recompile the
///     same get one cache entry between them.
///
///   - The shipped sources. content/src is compiled into the assembly, so an
///     updated port must rebuild. Hashing the text catches that without asking
///     anyone to remember to bump anything.
///
///   - The shipped config. content/config is the OTHER half of what goes into the
///     build: the function maps decide where every function starts and the SDK
///     address map decides which of them are bound to the runtime's HLE, so a
///     corrected sweep or a newly mapped library entry point changes the emitted
///     C# with no source file having moved. Hashed for the same reason and in the
///     same way, so a config-only change cannot be served a stale assembly.
///
///   - The launcher's version, which covers a change in how the build is done
///     rather than in what goes into it.
///
/// The absolute LBAs are deliberately NOT part of the key even though they are
/// baked into the output (Dispatcher arms an overlay swap on a CD read hitting an
/// exact sector), because they are read from the disc during the recompile itself
/// -- so a differently mastered dump of the same game produces a different
/// executable payload only if the code differs, and gets its own correct LBAs
/// either way. The recompile is under a second; the cache exists for the compile.
