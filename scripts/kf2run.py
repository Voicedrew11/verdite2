"""Launch the port, drive it through KF2_SHELL, harvest its stdout.

Every empirical claim in docs/ comes from a run like this, and until this module
existed each one was made with throwaway glue that did not survive the session.
The measurements are only worth as much as their reproducibility, so the driving
lives here rather than in a scratch file.

Four things in here are scar tissue and are the reason the module is worth having
at all:

  * Never `pkill -f` on a pattern that also matches the calling shell's own
    command line -- the harness kills itself, and the symptom is a run that
    reports nothing rather than an error.  `stop()` matches on the executable and
    excludes this process tree.
  * `state.inGame` goes true the moment the save is loaded, but pressing a button
    then lands during an area transition and is swallowed.  `wait_in_game()`
    therefore has a settle delay, defaulting to ten seconds.
  * Probes report per-second windows.  The first window is short and the last is
    truncated, so a scenario has to say which windows it means rather than taking
    the first or the mean of all of them.
  * The port needs a display.  These runs open a real window; they are not
    headless, and a session without one will fail at launch rather than hang.
