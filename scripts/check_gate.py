"""Verify the rule FramePacing states about its own gate, and report the gaps.

    python3 scripts/check_gate.py            # check; non-zero exit on a violation
    python3 scripts/check_gate.py --stages   # what every stage reaches and writes

`patches/FramePacing.cs` says **"can it draw" is the test each of those had to
pass**, because a stage that submits primitives cannot be skipped -- at 120 fps
three frames in four would have nothing from it. That test was applied by reading
the emitted C# by hand, once, and nothing has re-applied it since. Adding an
address to `DefaultGate` is currently an assertion; this makes it a check.

What it verifies, per gated address:

  * its subtree contains no `DrawOTag`, `VSync`, `PutDrawEnv` or `PutDispEnv`
  * it resolves to a real function in `generated/game.cs`
  * it is not itself inside a modal loop, where a whole-function gate would skip a
    whole session rather than one iteration

And what it reports rather than enforces: an `indirect` mark, where the subtree
reaches a `Dispatcher.Call` and static reachability stops being a proof. Stage 6
is the honest example -- it dispatches through the area module's header slot, so
"its subtree cannot draw" holds for the nine modules that were checked and is not
a guarantee about a tenth.

`--stages` prints the inverse, which is the part that goes stale in prose: what
each *ungated* stage reaches, so stage 2's deliberate exclusion stays a recorded
consequence instead of a remembered decision.
